P4 Precision Medicine Accelerator	http://www.p4precisionmedicine.co.uk/	-0.084997	51.521843	London	EC2A2BB	2.0630165456993165e+18	Precision (aka personalised) medicine is an emerging approach that takes into account individual variation to predict which treatment/prevention strategies will work in which groups of people. For example, colon cancers that have a normally functioning version of a surface protein called KRAS are likely to respond to certain anti-EGFR antibody therapies; those in which the protein is absent or non-fun. Successful innovation in precision medicine requires several sectors (academia, healthcare and industry) work together - often easier said than done. P4 sits at the intersection of these sectors, leveraging our academic, industry and healthcare connections to create a healthtech ecosystem to supercharge the development and scale of precision medicine technologies. Our flagship “accelerator” programme is the first of its kind in the UK, and is a partnership with UCL and Barclays.

Here at Personify XP, we have a passion for making everyone's digital experiences personal. Josh and Ben started Personify XP because we recognized that 95% of people who visit a website are anonymous and receive a generic experience. That's just not good enough. That's not because companies haven't recognised how important these visitors are - it's just that there has been no great way to do it. For so long companies have focused on ‘knowing the customer' before they can personalise to them. With GDPR and people becoming much more cautious over sharing data it has become harder to personalise to website visitors as companies know less about their visitors. Even when there is a lot of data available on customers it still takes considerable time within a company to segment their visitors and then manually create the user journeys for each of these segments. Personalisation takes a lot of time and a lot of decisioning - why couldn't all of this be automated? The Personify Anonymous Experience platform is the first platform to focus exclusively on anonymous visitors. Our AI platform connects great products with shoppers you know nothing about through automating how content and products are shown to which shoppers and when. We provide unique insight into how your anonymous customers shop whilst ensuring your customers data is private and we are GDPR complaint out-of-the-box. We drive 15% additional revenue and 35% higher conversions through our patent pending AI technology. We are delighted to partner with brands such as Hawes & Curtis, Finery London, Ghost and Interhatch to provide incredibly personalised experiences to their anonymous visitors.	1.0

Body Focused Repetitive Behaviours (BFRBs) that affect up to 1 in 20 of the population, and still carry a lot of stigma, with a lack of resources and support. Nudge is proudly raising awareness of BFRBs, conditions that can be debilitating for many. Nudge uses artificial intelligence, including gesture recognition technology and neural network programming to detect when you move your hand towards your face or head, and then alerts you with a subtle vibration. The band has an LED system that lights up to count the number of times that’s happened. We’ve taught Nudge to recognise over 1,000 hand and arm gestures, so it should always know where your hand is in relation to your face and head. And as smart as Nudge is, we love the fact that it works straight out of the box, no need to calibrate it or hook it up to an app. As soon as nudge arrives, it can be charged up, and users pop it straight on their wrist to start their training sessions.	1.0

QiO Technologies	http://qio.ai	-0.752502	51.295958	Farnborough	GU147NA	-7.775637772705774e+18	Well if you are like many engineers and manufacturers you've won an onslaught of hype, buzzwords, and a glimmer of hope that you can start evolving your operations with new technology to improve your business outcomes. As you start to consider that digital transformation, here are 5 reasons why you should consider QiO as part of that plan- because buzzwords alone aren't going to solve your problems. 1. QiO empowers clients to drive value-based innovation by removing the burdens of legacy software vendor requirements, dependency and thinking. Steadfast in our commitment to the success of our clients, QiO does not lock companies into perpetual software licenses, embed immovable consulting teams, or monetise our client's customer database. Simply, our clients own their data, customers, and innovation... the way it should be. See our Chairman Rick Haythornthwaite expand on these ideas in a recent interview with SkyNews. QiO Foresight IIoT Platform is built from the ground up by industrial engineers for industrial engineers to dramatically improve operational efficiency, productivity, and safety. Applications are infused with artificial intelligence, provide smart automated workflows for team collaboration and scale across your production and supply chain. Ingredients matter. QiO Foresight IIoT enables industrial and manufacturing teams to problem-solve, experiment and redefine production assumptions in real-time. The platform is built to securely accommodate any data, any asset, any source, at any scale, and on any cloud - edge, private, hybrid or public. Your problems don't live in silos, your applications shouldn't either. See how Rolls-Royce is using QiO to improve their outcomes. 4. QiO is the only company providing industrial engineers with a self-learning digital twin, PARCS® Profile, that is not limited by static slices of point-in-time views and becomes smarter with each deployed Foresight Suite® application. The profile uses design, manufacturing and operations data to create a single lexicon defined by five real-world factors - Performance, Availability, Reliability, Capacity and Serviceability. To further secure data and provide traceability across the supply chain, each profile is encapsulated with a unique blockchain key. Fast-track your digital program. 5. Digital progress usually requires a shift in organisational inertia to foster an Industry 4.0 culture. Having an experienced industrial partner who can aid in framing ambitions, navigating challenges and providing purpose-built tools is a must have on this journey. No more time and money wasted to procure and install compute, network and storage infrastructure or manage resource-intensive vendor contracts. It's time to demand more. These are just a few of the numerous reasons why you should make QiO your partner for your digital transformation. If you'd like to get started on your digital transformation journey try Foresight Performance® risk-free.	1.0

Qubit Health	http://www.qubithealth.com	-0.274417	51.390642	Berrylands	KT59HT		Qubit Health was founded in 2017 by experienced senior leaders and data scientists within the NHS due to a recognised lack of the right tools to deliver elective care management in the NHS. Successfully piloted at Europe’s biggest Hospital, the Qubit Pathway Management platform provides an effective integrated tool for elective care management, that has provided significant improvements in terms of performance, efficiency, safety and user experience. Through partnership with both clinical and non-clinical NHS staff the Qubit Pathway Management system has been developed with NHS staff priorities at the core of its design. By combining effective management tools with pathway visualisation and reporting, it provides a holistic and intuitive approach to managing complex waiting list challenges. Working in partnership with our NHS colleagues is fundamental to everything we do; by adopting an agile approach to product development we are able to listen to their needs and adapt the platform to meet changing requirements through rapid deployments of new functionality. During the Covid-19 pandemic we have added new sector-wide ptl functionality to help providers identify and share capacity across a sector, coordinate clinical prioritisation and model sector demand and capacity. Our Vision: To improve patient outcomes through intelligent software and smart data Our Mission: To innovate powerful software solutions that improve and optimise patient pathway management Core solutions: Patient pathway and data quality management software solution Our approach: We believe in the NHS and want to ensure that our healthcare partners have the best possible tools to meet the ever increasing health challenges of the UK.

Polychord	https://polychord.io/	-0.100832	51.453388	London	SE249LR	2.0630165456993165e+18	PolyChord is a spinout from Cambridge University, formed in 2017 to commercialise the unique and cutting-edge analytical data tool developed by two cosmology professors (Professor Mike Hobson & Professor Anthony Lasenby) both now directors of the company. The data they had to deal with came from the Planck satellite and went from the present day to the Big Bang, spanning ten billion years. The tool, PolyChord, successfully extracted the desired information from that data - and we now look to apply it to commercial instances where there are similar Big Data problems with issues of high dimensionality, many variables, complexity, and dirtiness. Many people these days claim to have smart data tools - PolyChord is a genuine step change ahead of the rest and can fit models to data when the task is exceptionally challenging, in order to extract information and make predictions. We have made progress by collaborating with large, dynamic successful companies, who have gathered data, prepared it for analysis, but have then run into difficulties with the number of variables, and high dimensionality. Fitting traditional models to extract this information is then impossible - this is where our PolyChord tool really delivers, and global optimisation is also achievable in many circumstances. PolyChord has this year been used to optimise neural networks, where we treat the honeycomb-like surface of the neural network as a high dimensional data problem in its own right and solve it using PolyChord. The result is PolyNet, a second tool for the company, and a new way of using neural networks for more accurate Machine Learning.

Phebi's award-winning software has two main parts: - A plugin that makes it easy to voice-enable any survey and improve the user experience. And, when people talk instead of type they say more, especially on mobile. - A portal that makes it easy to explore, analyze and visualize what people have said (transcription), how they said it (sentiment analysis), and how they felt about what they said (emotion analysis). It also makes it easy to tell the story in the data. Phebi provides emotion and sentiment scores to quantify the qualitative at scale. It enables researchers to use AI-generated tags and apply their own to identify and dig into subgroups and topics. And, Phebi identifies where peak emotion is expressed and facilitates downloading audio clips. In addition to data collected via the plugin, Phebi supports data collection via phone surveys and does analysis of long-form audio captured at call centers and through qualitative work like focus groups and IDIs.

Photier	http://photier.com	-0.208023	51.498446	London	W148BB	2.0630165456993165e+18	Photier is the world's first photo distribution mobile app that uses face recognition and AI in the event industry. Imagine yourself as a guest in a very crowded event. There are many photographers present, they are all running around and taking photos of everyone. You pose - the flash goes off, and you just walk away. It is very likely that you will never see that photo of you. If you are at a wedding, and if the bride/groom is a close friend of yours maybe they will send you a few photos eventually. The photographer approaches you, shows a single photo that he has printed of yours. It is not a flattering photo, but you will purchase it anyways, because you want a memory of this night. You will try to take a photo of the photo to share on Instagram, but the photo will look either blurry or the flash will go off making the whole thing impossible. The night is young. You have a pocket or a tiny clutch and a photo that doesn't fit into it. By the time you get home tonight, there will be many drink stains on that photo. You are also very likely to lose it, or to end up with someone else's photo. We at Photier hate this scenario. We think photos should be viewed instantly. And that is what we do. We make sure that we simplify all the steps in between the click, and you receiving the photo. The face recognition system takes a minute to recognise your face in the pool of thousands of people. We can recognise you from the smallest detail on your face. We send you the photo and that's it. The photo doesn't come with extra baggage. You can store it, stare at it, or post it - it's all up to you. Photier can be used in all kinds of events where a DSLR camera is being used. This may be at a wedding or a graduation, a ski resort or a private baby shower to name a few. As long as there are photos that need to go to their owners we can help. We like to think that the sky is the limit, and we work very hard to make that true.	1.0

We understand that shareholders and the public are becoming increasingly intolerant of project failure, particularly when it is often foreseeable and avoidable. We exploit the very latest techniques in AI and machine learning to leverage the knowledge and insights from a vast array of interconnected project data; identifying and joining dots in a way that until recently would have been unimaginable. This has the potential to transform how organisations develop their project delivery capability and in our opinion will deliver the most significant change to project delivery in a generation. Projecting Success are helping to shape the thinking on what is an incredibly complex but hugely exciting emergent capability. We use the insights from connected data to provide early warnings, suggested courses of action, interventions, checklists and contextualised feedback to help project delivery experts navigate their way dynamic and rapidly evolving project environments. Examples include extracting real time insights from market and contract data, integrating this with tender documentation and aligning the rich seam of bid data that exists within organisations. We also provide tailored insights on the profitability and delivery challenges from previous projects and use the insights from this experience to shape future bids; an intelligent and adaptive bid management capability. The capability then extends into intelligent scheduling, using deep learning to identify correlations in performance across each element of the work breakdown structure, across thousands of projects.

With immediate, fully objective and in-depth results, teachers can then work with our dedicated intervention package to support both emerging and fluent readers in their development. Following 30 years of academic research at the Karolinska Institute, which has selected the Nobel laureates in Physiology and Medicine since 1901, we first launched our unique method of measuring reading attainment in Sweden in 2015. After a successful entrance into the US in 2017, we then launched in the UK early in 2018. Our work across the globe is still driven by the same overarching commitment to education and literacy upon which Lexplore was founded many years ago. Literacy skills are fundamental to so much of school life and beyond, yet in the UK almost 148,000 children still leave primary school unable to read well. Our mission from the start was to provide teachers with the technology, resources and information needed to identify those struggling readers early and raise attainment for all pupils. Since 2015, our assessment has undergone much further development. Today, having conducted more than 200,000 tests across the UK, US, Sweden and internationally, we have featured heavily in the press, including on BBC News, been nominated for BETT, E-Assessment and ERA awards, and have been ranked 8th in Europe’s top 50 most innovative companies! We are also extremely proud that our assessment and interventions are helping to the bridge the literacy gap globally! Our partners at the LING Project are currently travelling Northern Ghana using our technology to raise reading attainment amongst the female population.	1.0

Let's Chat Ethics	http://www.letschatethics.co.uk	0.022091	51.948803	East Hertfordshire	SG90AE		Let's Chat Ethics is a passion project born out of friendship and a common interest: ethical AI. We met while working for an AI ethics start-up and after many, many AI debates and wanting to keep working together, we decided to start this podcast. To say that AI has taken over the world would be an understatement, and more recently the moral issues surrounding AI have been a constant source of worrying headlines. The discourse around ethical AI often tends to take one of two sides: the humanities against techies, the responsible philosophers against the mad scientists. We bring together the two (plus some special guests) to offer a more balanced view of a variety of topics surrounding ethics in tech. From racist algorithms, to killer robots and beyond, we hope that by offering multiple perspectives we can help mitigate AI over-hype (no, Facebook’s chatbot didn’t really invent its own language), and highlight the more pressing issues (yes, AI really is racist	1.0

Named after the famous physicist so beloved of precise measurement, the platform allows researchers to record, score, store and analyse video of Parkinson's patients during motor assessment. Once captured and organised, the platform uses a cutting-edge computer vision technique, called pose estimation, to objectively track the movement of the patients down to the fingertip level and deliver objective metrics of core symptoms, such as tremor and bradykinesia.	1.0

Or, to put it another way, if the CV doesn’t contain the words the applicant tracking system is looking for, the chances of being selected are very low indeed. JobRocket has analysed hundreds of thousands of job ads, CVs and applicant tracking systems to develop a unique algorithm that helps candidates improve their job match score instantly. Once job seekers upload their CV and apply for jobs on the JobRocket website (JobRocket is linked to major recruitment websites and has access to tens of thousands of jobs), the machine learning algorithm instantly evaluates key elements in the CV against the position advertised. It then generates a match score and constructive feedback on how to tailor the CV to get through the employers’ Applicant Tracking Systems and rank highly in recruiter searches.	1.0

We leverage OI to create disruption in the way we solve problems and arrive at new solutions from which we create valuable IP. Organic Intelligence is our own re-branding of human intuition and common sense. PRODUCTS READY FOR MANUFACTURE We use 3D CAD to design everything we do and can produce prototypes in a huge array of different materials using 3D printing, CNC machining and laser cutting. Our base in the Thames Valley means that we are close to the people and companies used by several large Formula One teams and Oxford University. Our production ready prototypes allow us to convince world class companies that we have got the answer and it works.	1.0

measurable.energy	https://measurable.energy	-0.976367	51.454364	Reading	RG17QF	-8.334935469918092e+18	"measurable.energy’s bold ambition: eliminate all wasted energy and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from buildings, automatically and without any extra burden to occupants. Over the past 3 years we’ve evolved from home-made smart socket prototypes and basic software into the market-ready certified ""m.e Platform"" with integral Machine Learning. It's the ultimate building control, automation and management system to eliminate waste. The m.e Platform focuses on Small Power, sometimes known as Plug Load power, which can account for up to 40% of a commercial buildings’ energy consumption. No system in any building can measure, control or automate Small Power in any useful way. Did you know that between 25% to 50% of Small Power can be classified as wasted energy and GHG emissions? This wastage comes from occupant devices left switched-on or in standby to large water heaters and devices being-on overnight for no reason. For any organisation wishing to be ‘net-zero’ Small Power waste must be addressed. The m.e Platform is designed to simply fit into this infrastructure and management gap, automatically identifying Small Power wasted energy and controlling it, reducing total energy costs and GHG emissions by up to 50%. Unlike others' efforts to fill the gap, we’ve created a hardware and software system that’s accurate, safe and effective. Our self-designed m.e Power Socket is a like for like replacement for any normal power socket or fused spur, is low cost and lasts for at least 10 years. Our Software is cloud based and features our own Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to identify what’s plugged-in, what state the device is in, and whether or not its wasted energy. We can eliminate wasted energy loads by simply switching-off, using it for Demand Side Response (DSR), or targeting use to maximise carbon/cost efficiency."	1.0

TVSquared	https://www.tvsquared.com/	-3.208791	55.947267	Edinburgh	EH38UL	-5.640483299077678e+18	Founded in an Edinburgh kitchen by a group of data scientists in 2012, TVSquared has become a multinational organization that's changed the way advertisers measure and optimize TV. For advertisers, the success or failure of TV campaigns was based on out-of-date, inaccurate information. TV ads were always bought and designed around ratings data - received about six weeks after a spot aired. Advertisers had no way of knowing crucial details about what spot worked best, on what network, on what day, during what time of day, etc. For a $202 billion global industry, TV advertising had no accurate way of measuring and optimizing TV. Our team of data scientists, many who spent most of their careers in fintech and e-commerce, found out about the lack of timely data analysis for TV advertising and set out to solve that problem by turning TV into an optimizable marketing channel. Today, more than 600 brands, agencies and networks in 60+ countries use TVSquared. Whether it's determining the effectiveness of a single spot, improving the performance of on-air campaigns, optimizing media spend, informing planning and buying or understanding the total impact of TV, TVSquared has succeeded in making it all possible.	1.0

From the types of cameras required, the ideal positioning of those cameras and how the software can be set up to maximise the return on the investment. Face detection is generally a term used for cameras and digital recording devices to pick out the characteristics of the human face and then put a coloured box around it. This is often then used as a trigger or an alarm of some sort to activate the system or bring to the operators attention that a face / person has been detected. Often these systems can only work on a small number of faces at a time with one frame of video. This is also the technology employed in mobile phones and gaming consoles. Face recognition is now common place in many domestic applications, in laptops it is used to to recognise the person logging in and to perform the login automatically, smart TV's utilise the technology to provide the viewer with a preferred channel listing. Track-a-face is a professional surveillance tool for government, town centre surveillance, shopping malls and other high footfall areas. The major difference between track-a-face products and its domestic relatives, is its processing speed. The software is developed over many years by Herta in Spain and is capable of processing 40 or more faces in a continuous video feed. It will detect ALL the faces, analyse ALL the faces and compare them with its database of known people. If it finds a match it will then trigger an alarm and bring up a picture of the detected person the picture from the saved database and the details of the person that are held on file. Providing the cameras are set correctly, the system has been shown to be more than 95% accurate.	1.0

TrafficSignals.ai	https://trafficsignals.ai	-0.123615	51.514897	London	WC2H9JQ	2.0630165456993165e+18	Thanks to rapid advances in cloud, big data and analytics, and the falling cost of these new technologies, our traffic signals platform, powered by artificial intelligence, is creating the next wave of disruption, growth and breakthrough innovation across the globe. Our platforms bring together communities of customers and partners, including developers and are enabling new levels of collaboration between companies from different industry sectors. This approach has historically resulted in the conception of entirely new ways of solving problems and delivering services. Our solution is built on the very foundation that in 5 years’ time we may have a radically different way of gathering traffic flow information. With research projects we want to go further than just integrating with all data, but ask the question; why could a car not tell a signal as it passes what it was like where it has been and what it is like now? The car could also tell the signal where it is going, helping it make a decision about which stage to give priority to. Why could the signal not then tell the car what the traffic is like on its way and how going a different route may be more efficient? This technology is here today and our approach, architecture and technology will mean these advances are simple upgrades not complete changes to the very fundamentals of systems deployed. TrafficSignals.ai vision is to challenge impossible positions and provide an innovative and deeply integrated approach to intelligence around big data, internet of things and other sources of data. The business strives to be first to market for product innovations, capability and business needs fulfilment. Our focus is on enabling clients to reduce revenue spends whilst increasing quality of service through machine learning and artificial intelligence.	1.0

Our products put intelligent self-analytic capabilities in the systems-on-chip (SoCs) at the heart of today's consumer electronic, computing and communications products. Our embedded analytics technology helps solve the most pressing problems faced by the high-tech industries today - including cybersecurity, functional safety, and the management of complexity. Our solutions also allow designers to develop SoCs - the driving force behind both performance improvement and cost reduction in the electronics business - more quickly and cost-effectively. UltraSoC's flagship product line is a suite of semiconductor IP that puts an intelligent analytics infrastructure into the core hardware of an SoC. This provides intimate visibility of the real-world behavior of entire systems. The ultimate benefits include robustness against malicious intrusions; enhanced product safety; reduced system power consumption; and overall better performance - with fine-tuning of end products even after they are deployed in the field. These capabilities address applications in a broad range of market sectors, from automotive and IoT products, to at-scale computing and communications infrastructure. Our products are used by leading names including HiSilicon (Huawei), Imagination Technologies, Movidius (now Intel) and PMC-Sierra (now Microsemi) to bring these proven hardware-embedded benefits to their customers. Our partners include Andes, ARM, Baysand, Cadence/Tensilica, CEVA, Codasip, Lauterbach, MIPS, NetSpeed, Percepio, Roa Logic, SiFive, Syntacore and Teledyne LeCroy.

Our intelligent analytics technology closes that gap, giving engineering teams actionable insights that shorten the total development cycle time, accelerate debug, and reduce risk and cost to ensure timely market entry. Analysis from SemiCo research demonstrates the bottom-line value of this approach - SoC design teams can double their profitability and reduce their development costs by a quarter by using UltraSoC. UltraSoC is an active member of the RISC-V consortium, which aims to encourage the use of a new open source processor architecture which has been dubbed “the Linux of semiconductors”.

Until now, however, measuring the non-financial performance of companies and investments has hinged on a patchwork on ratings, research and company disclosures. We built a way to objectively quantify company impact. We measure the ‘what’, instead of the ‘how’, by singling out the most important thing a company produces: its products and services. Using machine learning to draw from the latest academic insights, we can identify and quantify the negative and positive impact of a company’s products on the most pertinent sustainability issues affecting the world today. 45,000 listed equities. 2,000 sustainability concepts. The result is an objective, comparable and scaleable view of how every listed company affects the most critical social and environmental issues of our time.	1.0

If we achieve our mission, then we believe that one day we can use a virtual workforce to simplify businesses that enable people to utilise their creativity and apply their human touch to the business. Businesses suffer from enormous complexity of their processes and systems, and this grossly impacts on their ability to deliver solutions. We've all come to accept these inefficiencies as the norm. In the era of RPA and intelligent automation, we will start to look back and wonder how we ran our businesses in this manner. Virtual workers can support business goals in bringing together remote teams, and transform how people interact, by removing the mundane tasks that complicate or add distraction to a person's day. We believe in a world where machine intelligence and people work in unison, it builds a happier and greatly improved business efficiency. It will be the companies who adopt RPA, Machine Learning and the Virtual Workforce early, who start to dominate the market in terms of their financial performance and speed. We're at the point where these advanced technologies, formerly of science fiction, are now science fact.	1.0

ThoughtRiver	https://thoughtriver.com	0.151169	52.232284	Cambridge	CB40DP	-6.746802659455649e+18	Market leaders in contract acceleration. The problem with contract negotiation is that it is slow and inefficient, and therefore expensive. Each individual lawyer can waste hundreds of hours per year reading every word in every contract when most of the language is common and represents little or no risk. Once a lawyer has read the contract and understood the key issues, managing those issues to resolution is manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. Creating an issue list each time is difficult, time-consuming, and hard to maintain, so keeping stakeholders informed and collaborating on issues with colleagues is handled via email and phone calls. As a result, negotiations often descend into ‘redlining battles’ and interminable iterations of back and forth. The key to efficient contracting is the rapid discovery of issues, and effective management of the negotiation around those issues. Our technology uses AI to identify issues based on your playbook, previously signed agreements, and agreements negotiated by others. And it does so in minutes. You can then triage agreements, rapidly create and maintain issues lists, and collaborate with colleagues, empowering your lawyers to negotiate with more confidence and close deals faster with less risk. We intend to banish the phrase 'stuck in legal' from the vocabulary of business.

We can now tell wheat from weeds, and locate a plant to 2cm. Before starting work, we spent a year researching with farmers on what you need. In that time we have also built up a group of partners who are our first customers, and investors. The monitoring robot is in trial now, and we are collecting data to train the neural networks. The weeding robot will be ready for initial trials in October ‘19. The full service will come on line over the next three years. You care because you care about where your food comes from. You care because you are worried about the environmental impact of farming. Because not only do you want to make a profit. You want to hand the farm on to the next generation in better shape. You care because you believe clever technology is part of the answer to the problems with sustainable food supply for our growing world population. You care because you think Britain should play a part in creating the future. You care because you believe in the power of a few dedicated individuals to change the way the world works.

The Company is currently developing an advanced crypto-currency application incorporating its NLR technology, called the FreeMark. Reasoning occurs after semantic (meaning) and syntactic (grammar) patterns have been identified with NLP, so that the knowledge so recognised can be applied, not just understood. What good is understanding something if you cannot reason from it? Natural Language Reasoning is absolutely critical to the advance of the human-computer interface. “In my opinion, Worldfree’s technology is unique and a genuine advance in the Artificial Intelligence field. “Worldfree technology allows computers to reason from natural language in real time…” John J.

Wordnerds	http://wordnerds.ai	-1.596194	54.966398	Gateshead	NE83DF	9.171471759884983e+18	"A SaaS platform that genuinely understands language, delivering metrics-led insight from unstructured text... in all its misspelt, sarcastic glory. Traditional ""social listening"" software does a great job with quan data (likes, shares and impressions) but has never been good at understanding the text. Their word clouds are meaningless and their abstract sentiment scores are unactionable. Even the latest NLP models and techniques—from Google Bert to GPT-3—are only good for a narrow range of use cases or require manual model-training by advanced data scientists. As a result, big brands have had no way of understanding what their customers really think, not just on social but in reviews, customer complaint data, surveys and chat. Wordnerds is different. Founded by linguists, our SaaS platform builds on the very latest AI/NLP techniques, but does so through the lens of advanced corpus linguistics. The result is a user-trainable model that genuinely understands language. We group ideas by meaning—not vocabulary—and link sentiment to topics. We know that ""the 08:05 from Paddington is late"" and ""my train still hasn't arrived"" are the same problem articulated using different words. We understand that ""this water tastes like crap"" is an issue for a utility company and ""this crap tastes like water"" is a problem for Budweiser. We detect sarcasm, a feature no UK-based text analytics platform ever needs. We uncover the true voice of the customer, helping brands like P&G the UK Government and Nissan listen, understand and act."	1.0

Our patent pending technology combines advanced semantic analysis, statistical modelling and artificial intelligence to extract insight from text streams (social media in particular). It creates a detailed profile of anything that has some text attached to it, from products (via descriptions, reviews), to brands (through news, social mentions etc.), and people (via their social media usage). The profiles are then automatically analysed to deliver brand, advertising and market research insight. For instance we help brands to understand who their social audience is, how the brand is perceived, how their marketing activities impact their perception, what kind of users are more responsive to specific messages/products and how campaigns can be optimised to attract and engage the right audience... without resorting to lengthy and costly consumer surveys. Take another example, by analysing how people talk about a specific brand/product in real time, our technology enables the monitoring of brand/products/campaigns on any arbitrary dimensions, e.g. ""trustworthiness"", ""livelyness"", ""masculinity/femininity"". Who we are We are a small but focused team of data enthusiasts with background in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Statistical Modelling and Advanced Data Analytics. We work with Brand Agencies, Market Research Agencies and Adverting Agencies to make sense of and extract value from their data assets; we work with them to help their clients to understand who their audience is, how their brand engages with their consumers and what is the value behind each social interaction."	1.0

Its founders included Professor Roland Wilson from the Signal and Image Processing Research Group in the Department of Computer Science. Professor Wilson's research group is widely known as one of the best of its kind in the UK and has earned international recognition. Warwick Warp was born out of an interest in three dimensional distortion or ""warping"" of fingerprints. Distortion can occur when a print is collected either intentionally, such as at a port of entry, or forensically from the scene of a crime. This problem, and others such as low image contrast, scars and cuts can make fingerprint matching a very difficult process. By taking a new, inventive approach, Warwick Warp's novel and patent protected mathematical modelling technology that can neutralise these effects and substantially improve the success rate of fingerprint matching. This completely new approach to fingerprint matching exceeds established accuracy benchmarks and delivers ultra-high accuracy for all types of fingerprints. The performance has been independently verified (NIST PFT and ELFT tests) as being among the most accurate available. Warwick Warp's algorithms deal especially well with low-quality or partial fingerprints including: shift distortion, rotation distortion, elastic distortion, scratches, low contrast, smudges, problem skin types and low minutiae counts. We specialise in developing innovative software products that enable integrators and developers to incorporate highly accurate fingerprint matching into their solutions. The fingerprint matching technology is made available as Software Development Kits (SDK) and SDK has been optimised to address the requirements of specific markets: AFIS, police (latent prints) and standard LiveScan applications (access control etc.)."	1.0

Sanction AI	http://www.sanction.ai	-0.123615	51.514897	London	WC2H9JQ	2.0630165456993165e+18	Sanction AI is a machine learning company that specialises in quantifying and predicting the risk of securities class actions for public companies, institutional investors, and legal professionals. We use leading-edge proprietary natural language processing technology to accurately classify over 430 different types of business event for companies mentioned in the global media. We then apply machine learning models to quantify and predict the risk of securities class action litigation for each company on a daily basis, to help companies, investors, and their advisors mitigate, prevent, and defend class action claims. AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM FOR CLASS ACTION RISK We provide advanced class action risk analytics that can identify potential securities law suits before they get filed, giving companies, institutional investors, and legal professionals a vital head start. FACTOR ATTRIBUTION TO BUILD AND DEFEND CLAIMS When a class action claim commences or looks likely, we can help to attribute the stock price declines to specific business events. WHY SANCTION? In 2018, over 400 new securities class actions were filed in US federal courts, nearly double the 1997-2017 average. At the same time, the litigation rate for US companies rose to 9%, and 5% for non-US companies, the highest rates since 2006. Media coverage of these securities class actions has a direct impact on stock price volatility. On days when the media reported that shareholders were suing a company, there was a 19% increase in the daily volatility of those stocks. By combining stock price data, media coverage, and class action filings, our machine learning models detect when a company is at an increased risk of a securities class action and can help attribute stock price declines to specific business events.	1.0

Shadow Robot Company	http://shadowrobot.com	-0.148406	51.556016	London	NW51LP	2.0630165456993165e+18	In 1987 we began as a hobbyist group in our Founder's attic in London, where we were trying to create a walking, bipedal robot. Without warning, Honda revealed they had created Asimo, the world's first walking robot (which meant that our biped turned out to be Europe's first walking robot). Our biped was primitive and nowhere near as sophisticated as Asimo, so we abandoned the project (the prototype can now be seen on display in the Science Museum). We turned our attention away from feet and legs, and thought about hands. This was our starting point, to create the world's first, and best, robot hands. What helped us to develop this idea was realising that it's also easier for humans to understand how to control robots remotely via teleoperation, if the robot took the same form as the human hand. We formally registered as the Shadow Robot Company in 1997 and has since evolved into one of the longest running robotics companies in the UK, developing dexterous robotics manipulation technologies (‘hands for robots') and using them to solve real world problems. We have produced the world's finest anthropomorphic dexterous robotic hand, often used in research and testing, as well as developing our Smart Grasping System for the manufacturing industry.

Our walk-through scanners use space technology to image human body heat. Computer learning (AI) allows the scanner to distinguish between threats and non-threats but without the need for passengers to keep still or remove outer clothing. The scanner combines a number of world-leading technologies. The human body acts as a source of “light” by which the new scanner can see hidden objects which appear as a shadow. This is in contrast with existing scanners which process reflected and scattered radiation from a source within the machine. Sequestim scanners allow passengers to walk normally through security without the need to take off coats and jackets, or to remove personal items such as phones. It can also see inside moving curtain-sided lorries. The detector technology was originally developed to study the most distant astronomical phenomena. Its inventors want to know more about how stars are born from gigantic clouds of gas and dust. The scanner detects millimetre-waves, which are just like the light we see with our eyes, but at more than a thousand times longer wavelength. The ability of the scanner to reveal hidden objects has also attracted interest from Border Force, responsible for the UK’s frontline border control operations at air, sea and rail ports. Images from the new scanner do not show anatomical details so there are no ethical issues. In addition, the Sequestim is designed so that the whole system will operate automatically, and no-one will see the images generated. Finally, the passenger is not exposed to potentially harmful radiation like x-rays.	1.0

Morning priming to set the intention of the day and evening reflection to be mindful about the results. Questions you could be asked are: “How can you be 1% better tomorrow”, “What are the 3 priorities of today”, “How can you give positive affirmation to your team” In between you get reminders and tips, helping to take action Recent News ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rocky.ai is a TC Top Pick for the 2020 Techcrunch Disrupt even in San Francisco in the category education / social impact Rocky Robots in the Techstars 2019 BSH Future Home Accelerator program - February 4th, 2019 Rocky Robots Crowned Champion at the ""Machine Demo"" competition at RISE Conference - July 12th, 2018"	1.0

Stable came to life after our founder completed a Nuffield Farming Scholarship on the 'Simplification of Financial Risk Management for Farmers'. Richard's initial work received invaluable support from academics at the Universities of Harvard, Liverpool, Lisbon and Wellington, NZ as well as some of the world's largest insurers. Still run from a farm in Somerset, the Stable team now includes some of the world's leading Mathematicians, Agricultural Economists and Insurers. In 2015 we began work to build the platform that would become Stable. This was no easy task and required sophisticated algorithms and machine learning expertise to make Stable a reality. The scale of the challenge meant we also needed the extraordinary skills of the Virtual Engineering Centre in Liverpool and the use of one of Europe's most powerful computers. With the help of our global insurance partners and over 300 farmers, by 2018 we finally had the ability to deliver a simple, affordable and low risk way for farmers to manage volatile commodity prices. Our story has started in the UK, but plans are already well advanced to take Stable further afield. If you'd like to get involved in our story, then we'd love to hear from you.

Speech Graphics	https://www.speech-graphics.com/	-3.201752	55.946941	Edinburgh	EH39DR	-5.640483299077678e+18	At Speech Graphics we specialize in one of the holy grails of computer facial animation: automatic, accurate lip sync. Given audio, our task is to create the illusion that the animated face you see is the source of the sound you hear. This illusion is notoriously difficult to achieve: the movements of speech are fast, complex and subtle, and viewers are highly sensitive to any mismatch between the face and the voice. Our world-class pipeline incorporates powerful speech analysis and procedural animation techniques to achieve this illusion consistently, allowing animators to handle overwhelming demand for high-quality dialogue. But Speech Graphics goes beyond good lip sync. Speech contains energy and emotion, and that too can be decoded from the voice and synchronized in the face. Using all available acoustic information, our algorithms drive not just the mouth but the entire face from audio input, from syllables to scowls. This is an interdisciplinary problem and Speech Graphics has a unique fusion of expertise in speech technology and computer animation found nowhere else in the world. Our team brings together decades of research into phonetics, task dynamics, speech recognition, psychology, machine learning, computer graphics, physical models and more. And we have solved the problem of how best to apply our systems to real-world facial rigs.	1.0

Spectra-Scope® is a lightweight, portable device that detects the biochemical information of skin tissue using laser-induced plasma spectroscopy (LIPS). It comes with a deep-learning AI-based diagnostic algorithm for fast and accurate oncological diagnosis. Each emission spectrum of skin tissue acquired using LIPS has over 4000 parameters, providing detailed biochemical information of the tissue. The spectral patterns of the skin tissue’s emission spectra vary under different medical conditions. Spectra-Scope®’s deep learning-based proprietary diagnostic algorithm differentiates the conditions of BCC, SCC and malignant melanoma with high accuracy. The diagnostic algorithm was constructed by a deep neural network trained with a total 5302 emission spectra. Spectra-Scope® is quick, safe and easy to use. To evaluate the degree of atypia in a lesion, measurements are performed on a reference area close to the lesion, as well as on the lesion itself. The procedure takes only a second, and the LIPS score and the corresponding clinical predictive value of the lesion are displayed within a few seconds. Spectra-Scope’s® diagnostic accuracy has been proven by worldwide clinical studies in the United States and Australia. A series of clinical studies were used to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Spectra-Scope®. A deep learning-based algorithm was used to create a robust database of information, leading to ground-breaking accuracy in both sensitivity and specificity. The identification of skin cancers (BCC, SCC and malignant melanoma) vs. benign lesions were accurately diagnosed with 97.6% sensitivity.	1.0

With over 35 years' experience between them, they started out as machine vision consultants offering training and installations of vision equipment. After discovering they could build more powerful and sophisticated processors than the ones they were installing from suppliers (at a comparable cost), they rapidly found that customers much preferred their machines. Consequently, SIGA was born. A decade later and the expanded SIGA team now operates throughout the UK, Europe and US, and has become the global leader in machine vision processors, installation, training and problem solving, designing solutions for other suppliers and manufacturers around the world. They have built a strong reputation on their ability to move and respond quickly, and on their ability to solve pretty much every conceivable machine vision problem creatively, with innovative applications, technology and solutions.

Signal AI	http://www.signal-ai.com/	-0.088297	51.527447	London	EC1V1AZ	2.0630165456993165e+18	Artificial intelligence company Signal have been awarded their second Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with the University of Essex, enabling them to disrupt the UK media monitoring market. Run by Innovate UK, Knowledge Transfer Partnerships are part-government-funded project-based collaborations between universities and businesses created to help UK companies innovate and grow. Projects are designed to address a specific challenge or business need and give companies access to academic expertise and a grant of up to two-thirds of the project cost. The focus of this latest KTP project between Signal and the University of Essex is to develop new techniques to extract and visualise insights from unstructured text files, instantly converting large volumes of data into engaging and easily digestible presentation formats. A postgraduate, who will act as the research associate and project manager, is in the process of being hired and the project is set to kick-off in Q3 2018 and run for 18 months. Professor Udo Kruschwitz, from the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at Essex, will be the Academic Lead. He said: ‚ÄúOur first KTP project has laid the groundwork for automatically processing, classifying and linking textual documents, and has evidently done so very successfully. We are now at a point where we will be moving from knowledge extraction to actual knowledge understanding and visualisation. This is the second KTP between the University of Essex and Signal, the first one in 2015 helped the company secure investment of over ¬£5.8m. This played a pivotal and transformative role in the development of Signal's AI-powered media monitoring capabilities as well as the company's growth. Utilising the university's expertise in natural language engineering, Signal created techniques to retrieve, clean and analyse vast data sets consisting of millions of pieces of media content. Rob Walker, KTP Manager for this project from the University of Essex, said: ‚ÄúSignal has grown into a fantastic business, in an area of AI which is well-aligned to our research. In an era of fast news, fake news and ever-increasing demands on business to keep up with opinion; Signal Media offer an innovative solution using exceptionally developed technology. Building upon this capability, Signal now offers hyper-relevant, near real-time access to the world's news disrupting the UK media monitoring market and paving the way to further development of their product to support additional use cases. In fact, the partnership proved so successful that the graduate hired as the first KTP associate, Dr Miguel Martinez, is now co-founder and chief data scientist at Signal Media. The collaboration was acknowledged with an award for Best Partnership at the KTP awards at the 2015 Innovate UK conference.	1.0

All AIs need to learn and the best way to learn is to be able to make mistakes. Currently, when AI agents make mistakes, it drives humans mad, and we abandon the conversation. Sociate is making AI self-aware and giving it implicit emotions so that they know the boundaries of their knowledge. Our AIs use these emotions to builds empathy with people through voice, tone, and language, thus creating the ability for IVAs to have explorative and consultative conversations without being frustrating. This means our AIs continuously improve, learning more, learning faster and performing better on real world data. Our work giving AI emotional states also makes IVAs easier to train and allows us to put guide rails around generative conversational models - so that businesses can move away from simplistic tree-based chatbots with confidence. Our products are designed specifically putting the needs of humans first- so that business users and conversation designers can extract, view and analyse actionable conversational data with ease and retrain AI models directly and customers receive a superior customer service experience.	1.0

BYG Systems	https://bygsystems.com/	-1.90858	52.486481	Birmingham	B31UG	6.130629586618678e+18	BYG Systems started life in 1983 as a software house, nestled in Nottingham University's Science Park. Our trio of directors got down to the business of making a name for the company in the robotics and manufacturing industry. It wasn't long before we were developing cutting-edge 3D simulation systems for major clients and research Universities. By the mid-1980s we were working flat-out to produce exciting technology, attending conferences and shows to demonstrate our robotics and simulation software. By 1989, we'd evolved and diversified into new media, developing and supplying authoring tools to create Computer Based Training. With our talented pool of staff and willingness to change with the world, we expanded into providing educational services: our first foray into e-learning as it is known today. Continued growth in the 1990s resulted in major projects in Governmental, Finance, Retail, Healthcare and Telecommunications sectors. Our unique blend of experience of strong learning design, software, simulation and 3D virtual reality allowed us to craft solutions in learning and assessment, which other companies were unable to do. Whilst we spend most of our day producing exciting blends of e-learning, we still keep a toe in the robotics industry, with clients based in UK and US. In fact, you can still check out our robotics simulations today. Today we're one of the most widely experienced companies in the e-learning market. What's more is that we are positioned amongst the top 5 e-learning companies in the UK and Europe, with clients based all over the world. We travel all over Mainlaind Europe (and beyond) to meet our clients and build great relationships that result in exciting learning projects. Our range of learning solutions for clients have been deployed to complex, global technical infrastructures and delivered in over 30 languages to date. We pay special attention to reflecting the diversity of global learner audiences as well as tailoring all learning to specific target audiences. And of course we support our clients with software and maintenance packages to ensure learning stays up to date and fully functional at all times. From our humble beginnings we have grown a great deal, now employing almost 100 staff across various departments and we are still expanding. Together we strive to produce the best possible solutions we can think of. This dedication is rewarded by happy customers as well as awards. We know that innovation, creativity and forward-thinking are staples of any successful learning company and we have always focused on these qualities during our company history, changing with the market and often being the catalyst for change ourselves. We want to offer our clients cutting-edge solutions and technology that accommodate today's demand of flexible, robust and globalised learning. We challenge ourselves to always become better, innovate and evolve so we can anticipate our clients' needs and then meet them better than anyone else. They say a problem shared is a problem halved. We're interested in finding out what's challenging your organisation and sharing our expertise, ideas and experience with you to find a solution together.	1.0

We help companies track and reduce asset-level emissions and carbon footprint using GHG protocols (Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3). We focus on granular Scope 3 across the supply chain bringing accuracy and visibility through the value chain. Climate Change is one of the biggest existential problems we face as a civilisation. Industries have been a prime contributor to this. Today more than ever, businesses need to understand their true carbon footprint with accuracy across the entire value chain. As they are coming under increased pressure to be operationally efficient while remaining ethical and socially responsible from regulatory bodies, consumer preferences & financial markets. To counteract that, industries will face increased carbon costs for the emissions footprint. As carbon pricing is mandated and regulatory requirements come into play, accurate carbon modeling will require a deeper understanding. Across Industrial GHG emissions, 80% of emissions on average is contributed by indirect Scope 3 across the value chain. This means, in an organisation, the biggest carbon footprint is also the least measured.	1.0

Bidnamic	http://bidnamic.com	-1.532335	53.80049	Leeds	LS97DA	3.1677291454037924e+18	"Bidnamic is a marketing technology platform that helps retailers unlock the full potential of Google Shopping.. Standout had previously struggled to bring the volume of sales at a sustainable ROAS. The fashion industry is incredibly competitive and is dominated by big brands who have the budget to waste on generic search terms, pushing independent retailers off the Google Shopping carousel. Utilising the Bidnamic software, Standout has been able to compete with large fashion retailers, ensuring they are in front of the right customer, at the right price. Since working with Bidnamic, they have seen a 271% increase in ROAS and a 124% increase in conversion growth. Bidnamic's purchase intent engine ensures they are only bidding aggressively for terms likely to convert into a sale. Paying the optimal CPC per term ensures that Standout are maximising their ad-spend to its full efficiency.. Bidnamic was born out of our own frustrations with Google Shopping whilst scaling our own eCommerce marketplace, Dizinga. Bidnamic has enabled us to dominate Google Shopping profitably while eliminating the common problems associated with the platform.. The complexity of Google Shopping has gone beyond what a human can manage. Bidnamic overcomes this by combining advanced machine learning with human thinking to close the gap between where you are today - and where you want to be.. Standout launched in 2005, after the idea came about after a few beers in the local pub. Starting with only a few select designer brands, they now offer over 50 of the latest fashion brands, such as Superdry and Calvin Klein. They pride themselves on offering a large variety of the latest styles and trends in designer wear at the best price, without compromising on quality. Whether you want a designer t-shirt, hi-top shoes or a trendy accessory - you can find it all at Standout. Standout needed a solution that could help them stay competitive on Google Shopping whilst also increasing the volume of sales profitably.. The complexity of Google Shopping management has gone beyond what a human can manage. Bidnamic overcomes this by combining advanced machine learning with human thinking to close the gap between where you are today - and where you want to be.. Stitch & Story were wasting ad spend on genetic awareness terms such as \u201cwool\u201d, \u201cyarn\u201d. This is very common and very few companies using Google Shopping are aware of this. Bidnamic's purchase intent engine re-distributes ad-spend so that they only bid aggressively on terms that are likely to convert into a sale. The second challenge was the low average order value, as customers would place single item orders. Bidnamic increased the average order value by 52%. To do this, Bidnamic's machine learning technology first profiled every product to understand the relevant search terms and their performance. It then used this data to increase visibility for higher value products. Working with Bidnamic, Stitch & Story managed to increase their average order value by 52%, whilst driving brand awareness, resulting in a 19% increase in conversion rate.. ""]"	1.0

Cancer treatment varies from patient to patient and many cancer types now require immune-oncologic treatment or other forms of targeted therapy. How a patient responds to their treatment regime is not fully known which can result in patients suffering from unwanted side effects or developing potentially life-threatening immune-mediated toxicities. We are currently working towards developing cancer treatment response models using artificial intelligence. We aim to predict response to immuno-oncologic treatments in cancer patients by leveraging our platform’s capability to find features within a large array of asynchronous clinical and genomic data. We are identifying biomarkers that will predict response to immunotherapy, even before starting treatment. At the same time, Curenetics is also building a flagship AI model to match cancer patients to the right clinical trial, whatever stage of treatment you are in. Through our machine learning-driven algorithms, domain expertise, and ability to combine cancer molecular profiling data, we are giving patients hope by helping to recruit them to the most suitable clinical trials available. At the same time, supporting trial sponsors to meet their recruitment targets, saving costs, and reducing time to trial completion.	1.0

This is our story. Our founders, James and Paul, are proven technology innovators. Their close working partnership stretches back 15 years, creating their first business during the fallout of the infamous dotcom crash - and defying the industry climate to create software appreciated by clients in well over a dozen different markets. In 2012, we decided to build on our earlier success. With a deep recession as the backdrop for our latest challenge, our ambition became to use artificial intelligence (AI) to drive up conversion rates - and cloud.IQ was born. We evolved our powerful software to create a cost-effective conversion-rate optimisation (CRO) solution for ecommerce operators. Our creation struck a chord, and we became one of London's fastest-growing tech start-ups. Since then, we've doubled our growth every year, and in early 2017 we secured a further round of funding, led by London-based pan-European fund Nauta Capita. This latest investment underpins our rapid growth path, and will fuel the development of new products. We will also hire key new talent and fast-track our global expansion plans - enabling us to better understand and serve our customers, in all parts of the world. Led by AI and using machine learning, innovation of the cloud.IQ platform continues apace. We're determined to ensure that all ecommerce companies are able to benefit from cloud.IQ's ability to significantly increase revenues at greatly reduced costs - and to maintain our platform's position as the most efficient solution available. We started cloud.IQ because we had an excellent product and the desire to find a new working model. We wanted to create a business that is sustainable, provides long-term jobs, and supports our community.In a world dominated by internet giants, we wanted to level the ecommerce playing field. To develop tools that every size of organisation can afford. To make them fast, simple and effective. To make cloud.IQ - cost-effective conversion-rate optimisation for all.	1.0

AIMS DYNAMICS	http://aimsdynamics.com	-0.142405	51.518467	London	W1W7LT	2.0630165456993165e+18	AI based CRM and HRMS for modern 21st century management of employees and customers. AI could help augment skills by producing a third system extending on Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman's two brain or thinking systems. But new methods for general AI are needed. Most decisions in a third system don't have a clear-cut answer. Assessing the alternatives and the risks can be overwhelming made more difficult in stressful time sensitive situations. AI systems aren't able to build models for themselves by just observing correlations in huge masses of data - models need to see causation. And, would could solve lots of challenge areas in culture, productivity and performance. Outside of new methods needed a shortage of skilled AI people is another to cover the 22 million companies who could use machine learning. Kaggle's a platform for data scientists claiming to have the world's largest community with around 2 million members. PWC estimate there's around 2.9 million analytical workers globally.

aire	https://aire.io/	-0.111772	51.514455	London	WC2A2JR	2.0630165456993165e+18	As some of you might know, our work at Aire was the result of frustrations we faced in the current credit-scoring ecosystem. We set out to build Aire to be the change we wanted to see. So this is very personal to us. And therefore our motivations are perhaps different to other types of companies. Our founders have often stated, publicly, that the problems we are solving might take us 20 years or more to solve. Therefore, since our incorporation, we have established core operating procedures and guiding principles that prepare us to survive, and indeed thrive through multiple business cycles. In spirit of transparency, we wanted to share the ideologies that we believe will help us get there. Aire will always be focused on the long run and this is reflected in our strategy. We make decisions that are rooted in strengthening the core operating fundamentals of our company, rather than seeking quick wins. We are aware, that our business environment will keep changing rapidly, which we have to be prepared for. Research is paramount to Aire and our work. The company will continue to invest actively in research-oriented collaborations and fellowships at universities in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine-learning, neuroscience and design interfaces. Much of our proprietary technology stems from the academic research of our founders. Our culture at Aire, places a strong emphasis on experimenting and the scientific process. Therefore we work hard to recruit people who embody that attitude and then train them further for the skills they need. We trust our people and our hiring practices (which might seem unconventional) but ensure that we preserve that culture.	1.0

We work closely with customers to develop innovative digital products, specialising in data-driven applications and conversational UI / chatbots. Our work is driven by new technology, user centred design and Agile methodologies. What makes us different is the team we work with; all our people are experts in their field and have world-class credentials to back it up. We are a small, specialised team and we offer a highly personal and collaborative service to our clients. We think creatively about technology and implement it strategically. We invest in new and interesting ideas and regularly release open-source code to the community. Our recent clients include the Bank of England, UEFA, NHS National Innovation Centre, Turner Broadcasting, Internews, and Mencap, along with a number of smaller organisations whom we love just as much. To find out about what we can do for you, give us a call or send us an email. John runs an agile, knowledgeable and experienced team of developers with a strong focus on enterprise, data-driven technical solutions. I have employed them for a recent, very challenging project mining the group associativity of social media networks. I was highly impressed by the way John runs his team, the agile way in which they approach the work and even more pleased with their ideas and technical input. I would recommend John and his team at Atchai to anyone who needs a competent solution for any data-oriented enterprise project. What I like about working with Atchai is that they take the time at the beginning of the project to understand the big picture before choosing the right tech stack for the job. What they delivered was cutting edge, very high quality software. All work was delivered on time, on budget, to a very high standard with clear, honest communication throughout. Atchai Digital created a highly innovative visualisation tool that successfully demonstrates the value of open health data on an imaginative open-source linked data platform. This step-change innovation, which was profiled extensively at an international semantic web conference and a Guardian review, represents an important contribution to health informatics. Atchai's ability to work in development sprints that result incompelling customer experiences is a clear signature. Having put together a very well thought out and concise proposal we chose Atchai to deliver a new framework to power websites and digital products for our growing general entertainment business and brands. John and his team came up with a technical approach which has proven to offer huge efficiencies in the production of TV channel support websites. We now have an underlying architecture which enables quick and efficient rollout of new websites, along with the tools to ensure that every site we produce is accessible across mobile devices. Atchai were extremely professional, patient, and showed a great understanding of our often changing requirements and priorities. Their Agile approach to development, along with regular and effective communication allowed us to accommodate change and react quickly to evolving business and user requirements. I'd highly recommend Atchai and wouldn't hesitate to work with them again.	1.0

We are proud to say our Opportunity Execution Project made the front page of the most-voted list in Stanford University's recent course on Technology Entrepreneurship. Contact us through our front page if you want to discuss it with us. Our technology leaves us many free parameters to develop ultra-efficient integrated circuits for machine learning in many deep algorithms. Help us shape and chose those parameters so we can design the best chip for your application. Please visit our application calls page and answer no more than 6 questions to give us your view of machine learning and the opportunity ultra-efficient hardware would give you or contact us to discuss your needs. People like Hermann Hauser, founder of ARM, and industry big hitters like IBM and Microsoft say machine learning is the next big wave in computing after smartphones. But machine learning today consumes huge resources and is trapped in warehouses full of hot computers. In 2012, Google needed 16,000 processors burning megawatts of power just to learn to see cats in videos. This inefficiency severely limits machine learning applications in autonomous systems like robots, unmanned vehicles or the billions of sensors the Internet of Things will bring. Even with cheaper graphical processing unit (GPU) implementations, these systems would simply be too big and hot or tethered to a warehouse and power station to be able to learn independently. So we see a great opportunity in bridging the efficiency gap. We believe we know how. We are Artificial Learning Ltd, working with top UK universities to develop novel, ultra-efficient silicon chips specifically for machine learning. We want to make machine learning thousands - perhaps millions - of times more efficient. Instead of needing a warehouse and a power station, our integrated circuit designs will enable powerful machine learning to be embedded in devices that can sit in the palm of your hand and run on batteries.	1.0

Arline	https://arline.io	-0.123615	51.514897	London	WC2H9JQ	2.0630165456993165e+18	Quantum compilation is a problem of translating a quantum algorithm to a set of low-level hardware instructions to be executed on a quantum processor. Extreme susceptibility of quantum computation to noise is one of the crucial factors that hinder the development of large-scale quantum computers. By the means of optimising gate count in a quantum circuit, it is possible to significantly reduce hardware errors and increase the accuracy of quantum computation. Optimal (or near-optimal) circuit compilation is an extremely challenging and still open problem due to additional constraints imposed by hardware configuration, such as restricted qubit connectivity and hardware-native gate set. Arline project has been launched to optimise quantum algorithms with machine learning techniques. We believe that quantum-applied machine learning will make quantum algorithms run on NISQ computers and solve state-of-the-art computational problems.	1.0

gweek	http://www.gweekspeech.com	-0.098888	51.519542	London	EC1A7LP	2.0630165456993165e+18	In today’s world, where many of us are more comfortable communicating via WhatsApp and email than by speaking on the phone or face-to-face, the ability to deliver speech effectively is often neglected. gweek is a cutting-edge software that helps improve Speech intelligence through an advanced analytics and training platform, which provides immediate results and feedback in bite sized phases, to help people unlock their speech potential on the go. Unlike many corporate presentation tools which instruct people on “how to” present or speak in public, but often yield short term results, the gweek app - a “personal communication coach” - takes a more intuitive approach. Based on the belief that everyone is inherently Speech Intelligent, gweek helps harness the skills people already possess but don’t necessarily know how to use, such as clarity and structure in speech. The software is comprised of learning levels, to help users achieve key milestones, or to simply provide help with rehearsing speech. gweek is a cognitive technology in that it knows what to listen and look for in order to help in a constructive, non-judgmental way. gweek uses audio and visual layers of machine learning to provide real-time analytics and bite-sized, micro-learning chunks. It empowers users to express themselves more effectively, and to tap into their most valuable currency – the way they present themselves. It empowers users to communicate ‘with’ not ‘at’ people. Through the use of smart Speech Intelligence Analytics®, gweek has been able to consistently measure the components that make up clear, confident, yet authentic communication - to create a system which accurately scores users in real-time and helps them to improve their speaking capabilities. In both 2017 and 2018, gweek was recognised by CognitionX as a pioneer in its field by winning the AI Award for Innovation in Natural Language Processing.	1.0

Over a minimum of a 5-year period, Fusionex will be deploying Big Data Analytics to increase the efficiency of its client’s interaction with existing customers, as well as provide solutions to utilize available data in order to craft better offerings that would empower the client to capture newer markets. In order to gain a better outlook of the performance and health of the client’s sales activities, a cost utilization analytics module will be provided by Fusionex. This will help the client inform its corporate customers about the performance of their corporate accounts – e.g. details such as how much cost has been utilized by staff, how much was claimed for spouses or dependents, and even illnesses involved and medical facilities visited. This will help corporate customers determine if their account is being fully or partially utilized, and whether or not coverage should be increased for their staff. The cost utilization analytics module can also be used by the client’s team to generate new products that they can upsell and cross-sell to existing customers. Fusionex and the client will also be working closely together to formulate strategies to penetrate the insurance market through social media analytics and digital marketing. Capturing the right data in a timely manner is important for decision makers in the client’s organization, to determine long term strategies as well as day to day actions. To achieve this, Fusionex GIANT 2017 (targeted for official release imminently) will not only accumulate and cleanse disparate datasets, but also be used to find historical patterns and predict future trends in data (structured, semi-structured and unstructured). Via GIANT, the client will be able to determine claim patterns of its customers and will be able to craft products that better cater to these customers, focusing on their specific needs. The client will also be able to cross sell products if they identify, for example, the trend of city dwellers – e.g. allowing for targeted auto insurance products and sales. By putting business and customer data to effective use, the client is able to transform seemingly dormant information into game-changing insights that can help them satisfy their customers, improve their offerings, and boost their bottom-line. Ivan Teh, Fusionex Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “We are delighted to enter into this long-term partnership with such a valued client, which is in line with our mission of using technology to enable businesses to be more agile, and with greater impact. Fusionex is committed towards helping the client gain an optimum leverage in its field.	1.0

Generic Ai	http://generic-ai.co.uk/	-1.611337	54.972398	Newcastle upon Tyne	NE16BX		Our vision is to incorporate Generic AI into every system that can benefit from generic artificial intelligence capability. The system was initially developed in 1983 as a music composition tool, where the composer manipulates the paths of counterpoint melodies. The development of the system was inspired by Leonard Bernstein's Harvard Lectures on music theory based on Chomskyan linguistics - titled The Unanswered Question. Chomsky said: ‘He (Bernstein) was onto something, but I couldn't really judge how significant it was...'. Bernstein's analysis of Mozart's 40th in G Minor showed characteristics corresponding to the physical Principle of Least Action and symmetry over scale analogous to gauge invariance in field theory. This analysis formed the starting point from which Generic AI was ultimately developed. By 1989 the core theoretical problem was solved; this took the form of a general-purpose artificial intelligence system. However, it was apparent that it would be at least 20 years before it could be implemented, due to the rate of improvement in computing power. By 2002 parallel processing was close enough to start developing commercial applications taking into account the development time, and so the company: Generic AI Ltd was incorporated. Our objective is to demonstrate the ‘Artificial General Intelligence' (AGI) properties of the system by creating as many varied applications as possible. Generic AI has these properties: The core Generic AI system always works in the same way for every application It has no pre-programmed rules The data it processes is in a universal format Customised interfaces convert data into this core universal format Patterns and features exist in a kind of 'common currency' between all possible kinds of data input. This enables meaningful data-fusion between disparate data sources.	1.0

Our team is made of AI experts with backgrounds from MIT, Cambridge University, ETH Zurich, Ecole Polytechnique, BNP Paribas London, Paris School of Economics and Bank of France and whose research is cited by hundreds of scientific papers and published at the best international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AISTATS or AAAI. We are building a dashboard allowing risk/asset managers and their analysts to obtain the right information edge at the right time. We do so by dynamically processing news, press releases, company filings, investment research or earnings transcripts, and leveraging advanced AI and mathematical methods, some as recent as Fall 2020, including among others non-trivial usage of transformers and topological data analysis. We are motivated by mitigating the risks of another financial crisis due to a lack of timely access to the right economic insights. Indeed, the sanity of the global financial system relies on investors and insurers correctly measuring the inherent risks to their positions, and failure to adequately process the relevant data in time may result in credit defaults or under-performance: an overall lost value for the economy. What adds to the issue is that the amount of unstructured textual data available to the actors of the Finance & Insurance industry has lately grown to an overwhelming degree. Fortunately, 2020 has seen unprecedented breakthroughs in the scientific community of text analytics. We are here to take these advances from the research lab to the industry, with a unique geometry-inspired technological edge to data representations.	1.0
Future Perfect (Healthcare)	http://www.future-perfect.co	0.083854	52.036415	Cambridgeshire	SG88PN	2.998405938670466e+18	We make healthcare maximally intelligent by offering expert information for patients’ professional care and self-care, based on their diseases, genotypes, medicines and lifestyles. To do which, we provide integrated and interoperable information to whom, when and how it is needed – to clinicians, of course, and to the patient especially. By these means, we liberate them from disconnected silos that inevitably lead to less-than-integrated care. With advanced analytics and artificial intelligence, clinicians can show, for example, how multiple combinations of genomic attributes, prescribed drugs and test results lead to actual clinical outcomes. Using these analyses, clinical researchers can benchmark pathways and infer new best-practice, to embed improvement at great scale. Our “Future Perfect” for Healthcare: making health and care maximally intelligent will be achieved by: Creating the evidence base needed to inform how to care (or self-care), making it relevant, extensive, constantly expanded and updated Collecting the data from across prescribing, diagnostic, genomic, robotic and digital sources Liberating and democratising the data, breaking down silos, making it ready for us to develop and deploying new applications for advanced analyses Deploying AI tools to analyse such massive data - for example, to show the actual clinical outcomes people experience linked to their genomic attributes, diagnostic and interventive procedures and prescribed drugs Using these analyses to benchmark and infer new best-practice Closing the loop and re-do the cycle, embedding improvement at great scale. We are engaged to advise several genome programmes and e-Prescribing implementations.

By providing an end-to-end solution we are able to offer a streamlined route for water utilities to innovate whilst rapidly realising the benefits; without needing to piece together the solution themselves. Historically sensors have only measured a few parameters, our Intellisondes accurately measure up to 8 parameters at once. By measuring these parameters, we have managed to use our devices to identify the root cause of discolouration issues, water source mixing, leakage, chemical dosing issues and reservoir ingress, many of which are not possible without the combination of parameters provided by the Intellisonde. Often communications can be overlooked, but providing reliable access to data is key to being able to use that data for decision making. As a result, we created the Intellihub, our communications module, which is able to provide high data availability underground in remote locations, regularly achieving above 95% data availability in some of the most challenging environments. In order to interpret the data and make it useful for decision making, we created our intelligence systems which use bespoke AI algorithms to extract meaningful insights from the data. Our systems can work with 3rd party data or our own sensors, enabling the utilities to get greater value out of their existing assets. The data is visualised through our Insight web-app, this provides intuitive ways to see exactly which parts of the water network need addressing as well as offering tools to enable drilling-down into the root of the problem. Our system automatically processes the data ready for visualisation meaning information on water source mixing, root cause analysis for discolouration, leakage or reservoir ingress are all available instantly through our Insight web-app.	1.0

iAbra	http://www.iabra.ai	-0.53319	51.947158	Fancott	LU56BY		iAbra’s tools enable the creation of neural networks and their implementation on FPGA silicon for AI based image analysis. Artificial Intelligence is moving from the cloud to embedded applications. This is enabling a wide range of use cases including automotive, defence, manufacturing, healthcare and agriculture. Machine Learning ecosystems have been built mostly on GPUs for the cloud, where neural networks are generally very large and inefficient. These cloud based neural networks and power hungry GPUs make the AI use cases requiring embedded inference more difficult or impossible to engineer. FPGAs provide the ideal AI inference platform where low size, weight and power are design criteria. The FPGA’s efficiency and low power consumption are better able to deliver embedded applications. iAbra’s tools ensure that efficient neural networks are created and optimised for embedded FPGA silicon, delivering low power AI inference for a variety of applications. iAbra Neural PathWorks is the machine learning software platform from iAbra. It provides the neural network creation element of our end to end tool chain for embedded AI inference on FPGA. PathWorks can be made available on a Software as a Service basis, or licenced for implementation on a customer’s infrastructure. Neural Synapse is the AI Inference architecture for neural networks created in PathWorks. Synapse can be implemented on a Hardware Development Kit for testing purposes. iAbra can support customers with a range of services, from training and support through to neural network creation and testing.	1.0

This shouldn’t be happening. Technology has lowered barriers to entry and revolutionised other non-finance industries. Smartphone adoption grew 9% globally last year, providing a low-cost platform for consumers to access basic services from almost anywhere. Our app allows users to see all their financial data from one place, provides insights to better understand their finances and helps them build a credit profile to access products and services. We use APIs to connect users directly to their existing financial data for aggregation. AI analytics generate intelligent insights, which the user will use to access loans, credit, savings, insurance and investments. Our business model is B2B2C. We’re not a bank and don’t provide our own financial services but collaborate with Financial Institutions who provide products and services through our app. Our goal is to increase the supply of financial services to consumers and businesses, supporting sustainable economic growth and benefits for society.	1.0

Dynamify	https://dynamify.com	-0.093391	51.530785	London	N17GU	2.0630165456993165e+18	Dynamify, which sells software as a service to contract caterers so they don’t have to build their own online ordering platforms, is on a mission to rid the world of queues. Founded in 2015 out of Maxwell Harding’s frustration with lunchtime queues, Dynamify’s digital ordering technology is now deployed in North America, the U.K., Continental Europe and Asia. Contract catering clients include Sodexo, Elior, Atalian, CH&CO, BaxterStorey, Gather & Gather, Bartlett Mitchell, Lexington, Vacherin, The Good Eating Company and cloud canteens Nourish, Fooditude, Foodee and Alchemista. Dynamify’s modular technology contains all the features required by caterers within one app: ranging from preordering and self-checkout to delivery. Dynamify’s proprietary algorithm tells operators how long it will take them to prepare an order based on the time of the day and the type of order, then intelligently matches demand and supply to predict accurate order collection times and reduce crowding. Dynamify’s analytics dashboard provides powerful insights, including predictions of each customer’s lifetime value and food consumption patterns using machine learning, which can be leveraged for personalised marketing and inventory management. Dynamify’s contact-free technology has become essential for caterers to resume operations during coronavirus. Dynamify can launch a best-in-class app, which enables caterers to safely and conveniently provide food to their customers at the office and at home, within 24 hours. No external visitors are required on site to deploy Dynamify’s plug-and-play cloud technology – and a new restaurant can go-live with digital ordering in under 2.5 minutes.	1.0

Reproducible AI can't be productive or safe without reproducibility. This is hard in ML because it has many more variables. 2. Accountable When models make critical decisions, they must be accountable for how they were made. Models without full provenance can fail compliance regulations. 3. Collaborative For scalable ML teams you must be able to collaborate effectively to avoid confusion, rework and errors. 4. Continuous You are not done when you ship.

In contrast to an accelerator programme, DSV stimulates the generation of novel ideas through our proprietary process that focuses on first-principles thinking. This enables DSV to create companies that represent the “holy grail” in that opportunity area. The focus is on “tough” sectors which, relative to their economic value, tend to see fewer startups created. Companies in these sectors tend to draw more investment, create more jobs and move less often. They also tend to be more R&D intensive, and accordingly afford greater positive externalities than companies in other sectors. Visit our website for more information.	1.0		1.0

So we set out to bridge the gap between the insurance industry of today and the emerging technologies of tomorrow. We began in the commercial drone industry, using real-time data (like population density and wind speed) to quantify, insure, and mitigate drone flight risks. We insured thousands of innovative drone operations globally, from agricultural surveyors to NHS medical delivery flights. Our technology helped thousands of pilots around the world to fly safer, reducing their risk exposure by 15% on average. We recently expanded into the rapidly evolving world of connected motor fleets. Modern fleets change on a daily basis; expanding, contracting, and adopting the latest technology. They need an insurance policy that’s as agile and data-driven as they are; so we launched Flock Motor, our connected vehicle division offering insurance designed for the 21st-century fleet. But we’re not done yet. The world is becoming increasingly connected and autonomous, bringing both amazing opportunities and complex risks. As the insurer of the future, Flock will not only pay claims when incidents occur; we’ll help our customers understand and mitigate their own risks, to avoid things going wrong in the first place. We are making the world a safer, smarter place.	1.0

Download the full white paper here. The authors believe that AI could become the most transformative workplace technology of the 21st century, with the associated need for business leaders to assure themselves that they are deploying AI effectively and responsibly. Superhuman Resources sets out a series of practical questions for businesses to address in respect of AI in the areas of governance and quality assurance, in addition to tackling crucial legal considerations. These include privacy and data processing legislation compliance, the potential for discriminatory outputs from AI systems, and the fair allocation of risk. This guidance is set against a regulatory backdrop that poses distinct challenges for policymakers and corporate governance. While the growth of AI is no different from that of other fields of innovation in respect of the need to develop ethics and laws simultaneously, it offers a real opportunity for businesses to shape and influence legal and regulatory frameworks as they begin to adapt to machine-based processes, products and services	1.0

Evolution AI	http://evolution.ai	-0.093604	51.504989	London	SE11UN	2.0630165456993165e+18	Enterprises worldwide spend over $40Bn annually on manually extracting data from documents. This extraordinary sum represents hundreds of millions of human hours spent on tedious, grinding, soul-crushing work which is also slow and prone to errors. The incumbent technology, OCR (optical character recognition) has been around for decades. It’s simplistic, rule-based and performs poorly on many real-life documents. We founded Evolution AI in 2015 to solve that problem. Evolution AI revolutionised data extraction by building a deep-learning machine that closely mimics how humans read documents. Humans not only read characters off the page, we heavily rely on visual cues from graphic design (tables, font types and sizes, colours, bold/italic etc) and of course - on meaning and context. In AI terms, these translate to Visual Reasoning - a branch of computer vision that focuses on how objects visually relate to each other - and NLP (Natural Language Processing), dealing with meaning and semantics. In short, our AI weaves together text, vision and semantics to extract data from documents - just like humans do. Today we process over 1.5M pages per day for our clients. Our unique scientific approach enables us to automatically extract data from any type of document including the most complicated such as quarterly reports, balance sheets, P&L statements, account statements, invoices etc.	1.0

We read the full content of the search document and compare the terms we find with the content of all of the other documents in the dataset. This approach is at the heart of our long-established plagiarism detection programs. The technology can be used for the identification of relevant information in any large document dataset. For example patents databases (the focus of our first product), scientific publications, emails, etc.	1.0

The University of West London draws on a heritage of 150 years in teaching and professional education. First founded as the Lady Byron School in 1860, the institution as it exists today was originally formed from the merger of Ealing College of Higher Education, Thames Valley College of Higher Education, the London College of Music and Queen Charlotte’s College of Health Care Studies.   In 1991, the institution became the Polytechnic of West London, before gaining full university status in 1992 to become Thames Valley University.   The University of West London subsequently evolved through a number of mergers. It merged with Northwick Park School of Nursing, Riverside College of Nursing and the North West Thames Regional Health Authority's AIDS Unit in 1994, Berkshire College of Nursing and Midwifery in 1995, and with Reading College and School of Art and Design in 2004.  In July 2010 the University completed the divestment of its site in King's Road, Reading, (now known as Reading College) and in April 2011 formally changed its name to The University of West London, following prior approval from The Privy Council. The new name reflects a re-focusing of the University's activities on its Ealing and Brentford sites.   In May 2011 the University celebrated the installation of Laurence Geller as its new Chancellor. Laurence is himself an alumnus of the University and a leading figure in the hospitality and tourism sector.   From the outset, the University has played and continues to play a significant role in the educational, cultural and economic life of its region. The University of West London is home to a number of academic schools offering courses in a diverse range of subjects.   At the University of West London they aim to inspire students to become creative professionals and connect them to exciting and rewarding careers. Based in the heart of one of the UK’s most successful business regions, the University has a range of highly qualiﬁed staff, with a wealth of experience in their respective disciplines and strong connections with key industries.

Reuters Venture Capital	rvc.com	-0.154169	51.510551	London	W1K2NB	2.0630165456993165e+18	Reuters is the world's leading source of intelligent information for businesses and professionals. They combine industry expertise with innovative technology to deliver critical information to leading decision makers in the financial, legal, tax & accounting, scientific, healthcare and media markets, powered by the world's most trusted news organization. RVC, the former venture capital arm of Reuters, was set up in 1994 and began investing RVC I (originally known as The Greenhouse Fund) in Palo Alto, California in 1995. In 1997, RVC expanded the focus of its operations to Europe, bringing its significant Silicon Valley experience to a market with relatively few venture capitalists focused on early stage information technology companies. In September 2001, RVC became independent from Reuters and is now wholly owned by its Investment Partners and Chairman. It was awarded the contract to continue managing RVC I on behalf of Reuters. In establishing its investment independence, RVC has retained its strong relationships with Reuters, its affiliates (Tibco, Factiva, Instinet, Radianz) and its customers, which are primarily financial services and media companies who were amongst the first to be impacted by and adopt new technology. Building on RVC’s relationship with Reuters in financial services, RVC is developing similar relationships with leading corporations in other verticals, and acquiring deeper understanding of the needs and challenges CIOs and business decision makers have in increasing efficiency and/or revenues through their leverage of IT investments. In early 2004, after 10 years of successful technology investments, Reuters announced a strategy of refocusing on its core activities and away from venture technology investments. Over the ensuing few months, the partners at RVC explored the opportunity of buying RGF and successfully obtained debt financing for the purchase. On 22 June 2004, Norman Fiore, Martin Stapleton and John Taysom along with Chairman Sir David Walker became the new owners of RGF via their new vehicle Sofius Capital. RVC will remain the manager of the RGF and will continue to invest in RGF portfolio companies to maximise the overall return on the committed capital of the fund. Since inception, RVC I has invested €449 million in 82 companies, including Yahoo!, Verisign, Phone.com (now Openwave Systems), Digimarc, Infoseek, Orchestream, and Metamerge, amongst others. With 16 IPOs and 27 trade sales or other cash realisations, and a first fund that is 94% returned, they believe they have one of the strongest track records in Europe. Today, RVC has 11 staff located in London and the Silicon Valley.		1.0

If your business requires consumer adoption, it's not for us. We back companies that sell products and services to other companies. * Deep technology. We are firm believers in the value of meaningful barriers to entry, and we know there are a lot of ways to define and construct those barriers.  * Born in Europe or Israel. We know that great innovation can come from anywhere. Our focus is on companies born on the ''right'' side of the Atlantic, specifically in Europe or Israel. * Global ambition. While it's possible to build a great business without targeting a global opportunity, we are exclusively focused on companies that are chasing a truly global opportunity. In most cases, this means a focus on US market entry from day one. * Outstanding founding teams with domain expertise. We believe that great founders are the main driver of success for any entrepreneurial venture. We like ''well-rounded'' founders, but tend to prefer founders that are ''angular,'' bringing unique technical or domain expertise to bear. * Early stage. We like to be very early. We are not religious about being first, but most of our investments are into companies that have raised less than $1M before we engage.		1.0

Changing global patterns of food consumption and related consumer expectations are putting enormous strain on the sustainability of food production and natural resources. Further pressures will derive from the world's population increasing by a third and reaching almost 10 billion over the next 30 years. By 2050 the U.N. estimates that global agricultural production will need to increase by about 70%. Supply won't meet demand. Not without a more holistic approach to improve yields, soil and nutrient efficiency and reduce waste.  Food production cycles must be improved at every stage and for any solution to have a positive and lasting impact, on a large scale, it must be commercially viable.  Their work is to help meet this challenge.  Through the activities of over 2,500 people across 34 countries and the development of innovative technologies, they aim to contribute enduring solutions to improve efficiency in the production of healthy and nutritious food to meet the food requirements borne out of the increasing demands of changing global population. Their purpose is to deliver lasting commercial and social benefit, using their expertise with a far-sighted perspective. They apply rigorous financial discipline to their activities in order to achieve long term commercial success. But they do so with the aim of making a positive and lasting impact on society by developing and investing in solutions they believe will make a material difference in meeting one of the defining challenges of their time — the provision of enough food to meet the demands of a changing global population, in a way which benefits people’s health and wellbeing and nature.		1.0

WebStart Bristol	webstartbristol.com	-2.583545	51.448923	Bristol	BS16QH	5.3763668408451245e+17	Webstart Bristol is the brainchild of Bristol based entrepreneur Mike Jackson. Since selling his previous company and moving to Bristol from London in 2005 Mike has looked at many different investment opportunities. With a strong tech background having built and run web sites for Microsoft since 1994, Mike saw that investing in a single app or web service can be very high risk. Reading an article about the original Silicon Valley Internet Incubator, Y-Combinator, in 2011 convinced him that this was the safest route for investing. He then found that existing UK based incubators were mainly in London and required investment through a funding vehicle, not directly into the startups themselves, making it difficult for investors to benefit from the all important SEIS tax relief. With the establishment of the Engine Shed, Mike saw that Bristol now had the perfect venue for an internet incubator and after assembling a team of top Bristol based mentors and business advisors, Webstart Bristol was born.		1.0
