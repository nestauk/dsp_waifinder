Below we outline some of our current areas of interest. Today, there is great interest in the 'Internet of Things', in which many kinds of devices, from fridges to central heating systems, are connected to the internet. This technology will be capable of producing lots of data that can be analysed to spot emerging trends or events. For example, we are currently developing automated monitoring systems that can spot when an elderly person living alone has become incapacitated or is displaying evidence of emerging health problems (Find out more about our Case Study). In computer vision, we are able to apply a rich toolkit of computational techniques to intelligent scene analysis. Applications include visually-guided robotics & automated manufacturing, industrial fault detection & diagnosis, and event detection in closed circuit television. More generally, we have expertise in the statistical analysis and visualisation of 'big data'. These mathematical techniques can be applied to a diverse range of applications including market research, healthcare, security, science and engineering.",

Gallery: www.oxia-palus.com Contact: enquiries@oxia-palus.com Our work combines the technologies of spectroscopic imaging, artificial intelligence, and 3D printing to recreate lost artwork. Our vision is to bring to life an artist parallel universe. With potentially thousands of works of art hidden dormant beneath existing paintings the journey in resurrecting the world's lost art has only just begun. In September 2019 Oxia Palus featured in MIT Technology Review for reconstructing La Femme Perdue and subsequently gained worldwide press coverage. Since then Oxia Palus has presented research at NeurIPS 2019, came 3rd in NVIDIA's Top 10 AI Developer Stories of 2019 and recently featured in NVIDIA's GTC 2020 Keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. In May 2020 Oxia Palus joined NVIDIA's Inception Program. In October 2020 we featured in NVIDIA's GTC Inaugural AI Art Gallery to unveil Madonna, a lost Leonardo da Vinci, hidden beneath da Vinci's Virgin of the Rocks. In December 2020 we partnered with MORF Gallery, a futuristic online gallery showcasing limited edition fine art. In 2021 Oxia Palus joined Conception X. In April 2021, Oxia Palus and MORF Gallery unveiled and sold The World's First NeoMaster - Parc del Laberint d'Horta - a lost masterpiece resurrected on canvas using spectroscopy, artificial intelligence and 3D printing paired with an NFT. In June 2021 Oxia Palus won CogX's Best Innovation in Creative Arts 2021 and showcased World's First NeoMaster Exhibition at the Lebenson Gallery in London. We plan to showcase new work at London's first AI dedicated art fair, Deeep, from 13 - 17th October 2021. Founded in London in January 2019 by George Cann and Anthony Bourached.",

      "description": "Precision (aka personalised) medicine is an emerging approach that takes into account individual variation to predict which treatment/prevention strategies will work in which groups of people. For example, colon cancers that have a normally functioning version of a surface protein called KRAS are likely to respond to certain anti-EGFR antibody therapies; those in which the protein is absent or non-fun. Successful innovation in precision medicine requires several sectors (academia, healthcare and industry) work together - often easier said than done. P4 sits at the intersection of these sectors, leveraging our academic, industry and healthcare connections to create a healthtech ecosystem to supercharge the development and scale of precision medicine technologies. Our flagship \"accelerator\" programme is the first of its kind in the UK, and is a partnership with UCL and Barclays. The first cohort in the accelerator are nearly half-way through the 12 month programme. So far, the accelerator has supported these 11 companies to raise \u00a330million, receive 9 research grants and hire 7 new employees. The accelerator provides start-ups with personalized connections and introductions, as well as other support including workshops, personalised coaching (grant writing, AI and IP/regulations), testbeds and trial opportunities and regulatory pathway support to CE marking.

Utilizing an intelligent Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV), Perceptual Robotics provides existing inspection engineers with a new, cost effective inspection tool that increases number of inspections, and quality, whilst minimising health and safety risks. Dhalion is an autonomous inspection platform for wind turbines. At the press of a button Dhalion allows existing O&M teams to complete wind turbine inspections in minutes rather hours with increased inspection quality. The path is optimised for optimum coverage, reliability in weather and consistent data acquisiton. Throughout the flight Dhalion minds its surrounding and deals intelligently with obstacles and unexpected situations. The inspection data are then automatically distilled to useful information about position, size and severity of defects on the tower and blades. It can identify lightning strikes, cracks, erosion and delamination as well as highlight anything out of the ordinary. The consistent data capture allows for long term analytics from data mining massive amounts of information to inform O&M decision making.",

      "description": "AI & Automation Personalisation SAAS Technology. Here at Personify XP, we have a passion for making everyone's digital experiences personal. Josh and Ben started Personify XP because we recognized that 95% of people who visit a website are anonymous and receive a generic experience. That's just not good enough. That's not because companies haven't recognised how important these visitors are - it's just that there has been no great way to do it. For so long companies have focused on 'knowing the customer' before they can personalise to them. With GDPR and people becoming much more cautious over sharing data it has become harder to personalise to website visitors as companies know less about their visitors. Even when there is a lot of data available on customers it still takes considerable time within a company to segment their visitors and then manually create the user journeys for each of these segments. Personalisation takes a lot of time and a lot of decisioning - why couldn't all of this be automated? The Personify Anonymous Experience platform is the first platform to focus exclusively on anonymous visitors. Our AI platform connects great products with shoppers you know nothing about through automating how content and products are shown to which shoppers and when. We provide unique insight into how your anonymous customers shop whilst ensuring your customers data is private and we are GDPR complaint out-of-the-box. We drive 15% additional revenue and 35% higher conversions through our patent pending AI technology. We are delighted to partner with brands such as Hawes & Curtis, Finery London, Ghost and Interhatch to provide incredibly personalised experiences to their anonymous visitors.",

Body Focused Repetitive Behaviours (BFRBs) that affect up to 1 in 20 of the population, and still carry a lot of stigma, with a lack of resources and support. Nudge is proudly raising awareness of BFRBs, conditions that can be debilitating for many. Nudge uses artificial intelligence, including gesture recognition technology and neural network programming to detect when you move your hand towards your face or head, and then alerts you with a subtle vibration. The band has an LED system that lights up to count the number of times that's happened. We've taught Nudge to recognise over 1,000 hand and arm gestures, so it should always know where your hand is in relation to your face and head. And as smart as Nudge is, we love the fact that it works straight out of the box, no need to calibrate it or hook it up to an app. As soon as nudge arrives, it can be charged up, and users pop it straight on their wrist to start their training sessions.",

The disconnect between design and operation adds to the challenges, as does needing to reduce COVID19 transmission in stations and building passenger confidence that it's safe to return. Using our deep sector expertise and fresh thinking, we have created the solution. Our software platform enables you to use computer vision, AI, IoT, visualisation and gaming technology to shine the light of data and insights on your people flow challenges. Through real-time pedestrian simulation, predictive analytics and synthetic built-environments we help you to put people at the heart of mobility hub decision-making.",

We created Phebi so quantitative and qualitative researchers could better understand what's in people's heads and hearts. Simple, affordable, and quick-to-deploy, Phebi empowers researchers to collect and analyze what people say, gain insights they can't get any other way, and better predict behavior. Phebi's award-winning software has two main parts: - A plugin that makes it easy to voice-enable any survey and improve the user experience. And, when people talk instead of type they say more, especially on mobile. - A portal that makes it easy to explore, analyze and visualize what people have said (transcription), how they said it (sentiment analysis), and how they felt about what they said (emotion analysis). It also makes it easy to tell the story in the data. Phebi provides emotion and sentiment scores to quantify the qualitative at scale. It enables researchers to use AI-generated tags and apply their own to identify and dig into subgroups and topics. And, Phebi identifies where peak emotion is expressed and facilitates downloading audio clips. In addition to data collected via the plugin, Phebi supports data collection via phone surveys and does analysis of long-form audio captured at call centers and through qualitative work like focus groups and IDIs.

      "description": "Well if you are like many engineers and manufacturers you've won an onslaught of hype, buzzwords, and a glimmer of hope that you can start evolving your operations with new technology to improve your business outcomes. As you start to consider that digital transformation, here are 5 reasons why you should consider QiO as part of that plan- because buzzwords alone aren't going to solve your problems. 1. QiO empowers clients to drive value-based innovation by removing the burdens of legacy software vendor requirements, dependency and thinking. Steadfast in our commitment to the success of our clients, QiO does not lock companies into perpetual software licenses, embed immovable consulting teams, or monetise our client's customer database. Simply, our clients own their data, customers, and innovation... the way it should be. See our Chairman Rick Haythornthwaite expand on these ideas in a recent interview with SkyNews. QiO Foresight IIoT Platform is built from the ground up by industrial engineers for industrial engineers to dramatically improve operational efficiency, productivity, and safety. Applications are infused with artificial intelligence, provide smart automated workflows for team collaboration and scale across your production and supply chain. Ingredients matter. QiO Foresight IIoT enables industrial and manufacturing teams to problem-solve, experiment and redefine production assumptions in real-time. The platform is built to securely accommodate any data, any asset, any source, at any scale, and on any cloud - edge, private, hybrid or public. Your problems don't live in silos, your applications shouldn't either. See how Rolls-Royce is using QiO to improve their outcomes. 4. QiO is the only company providing industrial engineers with a self-learning digital twin, PARCS Profile, that is not limited by static slices of point-in-time views and becomes smarter with each deployed Foresight Suite application. The profile uses design, manufacturing and operations data to create a single lexicon defined by five real-world factors - Performance, Availability, Reliability, Capacity and Serviceability. To further secure data and provide traceability across the supply chain, each profile is encapsulated with a unique blockchain key. Fast-track your digital program. 5. Digital progress usually requires a shift in organisational inertia to foster an Industry 4.0 culture. Having an experienced industrial partner who can aid in framing ambitions, navigating challenges and providing purpose-built tools is a must have on this journey. No more time and money wasted to procure and install compute, network and storage infrastructure or manage resource-intensive vendor contracts. It's time to demand more. These are just a few of the numerous reasons why you should make QiO your partner for your digital transformation. If you'd like to get started on your digital transformation journey try Foresight Performance risk-free.",

      "description": "PolyChord is a spinout from Cambridge University, formed in 2017 to commercialise the unique and cutting-edge analytical data tool developed by two cosmology professors (Professor Mike Hobson & Professor Anthony Lasenby) both now directors of the company. The data they had to deal with came from the Planck satellite and went from the present day to the Big Bang, spanning ten billion years. The tool, PolyChord, successfully extracted the desired information from that data - and we now look to apply it to commercial instances where there are similar Big Data problems with issues of high dimensionality, many variables, complexity, and dirtiness. Many people these days claim to have smart data tools - PolyChord is a genuine step change ahead of the rest and can fit models to data when the task is exceptionally challenging, in order to extract information and make predictions. We have made progress by collaborating with large, dynamic successful companies, who have gathered data, prepared it for analysis, but have then run into difficulties with the number of variables, and high dimensionality. Fitting traditional models to extract this information is then impossible - this is where our PolyChord tool really delivers, and global optimisation is also achievable in many circumstances. PolyChord has this year been used to optimise neural networks, where we treat the honeycomb-like surface of the neural network as a high dimensional data problem in its own right and solve it using PolyChord. The result is PolyNet, a second tool for the company, and a new way of using neural networks for more accurate Machine Learning.

There are many photographers present, they are all running around and taking photos of everyone. You pose - the flash goes off, and you just walk away. It is very likely that you will never see that photo of you. If you are at a wedding, and if the bride/groom is a close friend of yours maybe they will send you a few photos eventually. The photographer approaches you, shows a single photo that he has printed of yours. It is not a flattering photo, but you will purchase it anyways, because you want a memory of this night. You will try to take a photo of the photo to share on Instagram, but the photo will look either blurry or the flash will go off making the whole thing impossible. The night is young. You have a pocket or a tiny clutch and a photo that doesn't fit into it. By the time you get home tonight, there will be many drink stains on that photo. You are also very likely to lose it, or to end up with someone else's photo. We at Photier hate this scenario. We think photos should be viewed instantly. And that is what we do. We make sure that we simplify all the steps in between the click, and you receiving the photo. The face recognition system takes a minute to recognise your face in the pool of thousands of people. We can recognise you from the smallest detail on your face. We send you the photo and that's it. The photo doesn't come with extra baggage. You can store it, stare at it, or post it - it's all up to you. Photier can be used in all kinds of events where a DSLR camera is being used. This may be at a wedding or a graduation, a ski resort or a private baby shower to name a few. As long as there are photos that need to go to their owners we can help. We like to think that the sky is the limit, and we work very hard to make that true.",

      "description": "Projecting Success helps organisations to leverage data and experience to solve complex portfolio, programme and project management challenges. We understand that shareholders and the public are becoming increasingly intolerant of project failure, particularly when it is often foreseeable and avoidable. We exploit the very latest techniques in AI and machine learning to leverage the knowledge and insights from a vast array of interconnected project data; identifying and joining dots in a way that until recently would have been unimaginable. This has the potential to transform how organisations develop their project delivery capability and in our opinion will deliver the most significant change to project delivery in a generation. Projecting Success are helping to shape the thinking on what is an incredibly complex but hugely exciting emergent capability. We use the insights from connected data to provide early warnings, suggested courses of action, interventions, checklists and contextualised feedback to help project delivery experts navigate their way dynamic and rapidly evolving project environments. Examples include extracting real time insights from market and contract data, integrating this with tender documentation and aligning the rich seam of bid data that exists within organisations. We also provide tailored insights on the profitability and delivery challenges from previous projects and use the insights from this experience to shape future bids; an intelligent and adaptive bid management capability. The capability then extends into intelligent scheduling, using deep learning to identify correlations in performance across each element of the work breakdown structure, across thousands of projects. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. Our capabilities are truly revolutionary.",

      "description": "Logic Programming Associates (LPA) is a company specializing in logic programming and artificial intelligence software. LPA was founded in 1980 and is widely known for its range of Prolog compilers and more recently for VisiRule. LPA was established to exploit research at Imperial College, London into logic programming carried out under the supervision of Prof Robert Kowalski. One of the first implementations made available by LPA was micro-PROLOG which ran on popular 8-bit home computers such as the Sinclair Spectrum and Apple II. This was followed by micro-PROLOG Professional one of the first Prolog implementations for MS-DOS. As well as continue with Prolog compiler technology development, LPA has a track record of creating innovative associated tools and products to address specific challenges and opportunities. In 1989, LPA developed the Flex expert system toolkit, which incorporated frame-based reasoning with inheritance, rule-based programming and data-driven procedures. Flex has its own English-like Knowledge Specification Language (KSL) which means that knowledge and rules are defined in an easy-to-read and understand way. In 1992, LPA helped set up the Prolog Vendors Group, a not-for-profit organization whose aim was to help promote Prolog by making people aware of its usage in industry. In 2000, LPA helped set up Business Integrity, now a leading supplier of document assembly and contract creation software solutions for the legal market. LPA's core product is LPA Prolog for Windows, a compiler and development system for the Microsoft Windows platform. The current LPA software range comprises an integrated AI toolset which covers various aspects of Artificial Intelligence including Logic Programming, Expert Systems, Knowledge-based Systems, Data Mining, Agents and Case-based reasoning etc. In 2004, LPA launched VisiRule a graphical tool for developing knowledge-based and decision support systems. VisiRule has been used in various sectors, to build legal expert systems, machine diagnostic programs, medical and financial advice systems, etc.",

With immediate, fully objective and in-depth results, teachers can then work with our dedicated intervention package to support both emerging and fluent readers in their development. Following 30 years of academic research at the Karolinska Institute, which has selected the Nobel laureates in Physiology and Medicine since 1901, we first launched our unique method of measuring reading attainment in Sweden in 2015. After a successful entrance into the US in 2017, we then launched in the UK early in 2018. Our work across the globe is still driven by the same overarching commitment to education and literacy upon which Lexplore was founded many years ago. Literacy skills are fundamental to so much of school life and beyond, yet in the UK almost 148,000 children still leave primary school unable to read well. Our mission from the start was to provide teachers with the technology, resources and information needed to identify those struggling readers early and raise attainment for all pupils. Since 2015, our assessment has undergone much further development. Today, having conducted more than 200,000 tests across the UK, US, Sweden and internationally, we have featured heavily in the press, including on BBC News, been nominated for BETT, E-Assessment and ERA awards, and have been ranked 8th in Europe's top 50 most innovative companies! We are also extremely proud that our assessment and interventions are helping to the bridge the literacy gap globally!

We met while working for an AI ethics start-up and after many, many AI debates and wanting to keep working together, we decided to start this podcast. To say that AI has taken over the world would be an understatement, and more recently the moral issues surrounding AI have been a constant source of worrying headlines. The discourse around ethical AI often tends to take one of two sides: the humanities against techies, the responsible philosophers against the mad scientists. We bring together the two (plus some special guests) to offer a more balanced view of a variety of topics surrounding ethics in tech. From racist algorithms, to killer robots and beyond, we hope that by offering multiple perspectives we can help mitigate AI over-hype (no, Facebook's chatbot didn't really invent its own language), and highlight the more pressing issues (yes, AI really is racist",

We have active programmes across a variety of cancer indications and disease biology fields, and we are seeking strategic alliances with pharma companies who wish to leverage our world-leading data and platforms. WHAT WE DO We apply the power of large-scale genomics and artificial intelligence to identify the genetic drivers of cancers and develop drugs to exploit their weaknesses. HOW WE DO IT We generate massive datasets using next generation tumour systems and advanced genomic technologies. Our AI-platform has been refined and validated over the past decade to prioritise key anti-cancer targets and to genetically identify those patient groups most likely to respond to treatments developed against those targets.

Our Artificial Intelligence algorithms analyze different asset classes with specific models for single-stock equity investing and multi-asset class allocation. We believe that today the world of investments has become a \"tech game\", the Internet has democratised access to traditional information and levelled out the asymmetries among the market players. The scientific method and state-of-the-art technology are the only way to extract significant information signals from the background noise of the markets - our algorithms analyse tens of millions of data points every month. At MDOTM data is where it all begins: we collect and clean the huge volume of noisy market data produced every day. Then, using Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and advanced statistical techniques we analyse these large datasets, train our algorithms and develop actionable investment strategies that exploit known market inefficiencies. We specialise in establishing the real financial significance of the statistical research findings. MDOTM was founded in London in late 2015 by Tommaso Migliore and Federico Mazzorin, graduates in finance and physics respectively and childhood friends.

      "description": "measurable.energy's bold ambition: eliminate all wasted energy and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from buildings, automatically and without any extra burden to occupants. Over the past 3 years we've evolved from home-made smart socket prototypes and basic software into the market-ready certified \"m.e Platform\" with integral Machine Learning. It's the ultimate building control, automation and management system to eliminate waste. The m.e Platform focuses on Small Power, sometimes known as Plug Load power, which can account for up to 40% of a commercial buildings' energy consumption. No system in any building can measure, control or automate Small Power in any useful way. Did you know that between 25% to 50% of Small Power can be classified as wasted energy and GHG emissions? This wastage comes from occupant devices left switched-on or in standby to large water heaters and devices being-on overnight for no reason. For any organisation wishing to be 'net-zero' Small Power waste must be addressed. The m.e Platform is designed to simply fit into this infrastructure and management gap, automatically identifying Small Power wasted energy and controlling it, reducing total energy costs and GHG emissions by up to 50%. Unlike others' efforts to fill the gap, we've created a hardware and software system that's accurate, safe and effective. Our self-designed m.e Power Socket is a like for like replacement for any normal power socket or fused spur, is low cost and lasts for at least 10 years. Our Software is cloud based and features our own Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to identify what's plugged-in, what state the device is in, and whether or not its wasted energy. We can eliminate wasted energy loads by simply switching-off, using it for Demand Side Response (DSR), or targeting use to maximise carbon/cost efficiency.",

      "description": "Founded in an Edinburgh kitchen by a group of data scientists in 2012, TVSquared has become a multinational organization that's changed the way advertisers measure and optimize TV. For advertisers, the success or failure of TV campaigns was based on out-of-date, inaccurate information. TV ads were always bought and designed around ratings data - received about six weeks after a spot aired. Advertisers had no way of knowing crucial details about what spot worked best, on what network, on what day, during what time of day, etc. For a $202 billion global industry, TV advertising had no accurate way of measuring and optimizing TV. Our team of data scientists, many who spent most of their careers in fintech and e-commerce, found out about the lack of timely data analysis for TV advertising and set out to solve that problem by turning TV into an optimizable marketing channel. Today, more than 600 brands, agencies and networks in 60+ countries use TVSquared. Whether it's determining the effectiveness of a single spot, improving the performance of on-air campaigns, optimizing media spend, informing planning and buying or understanding the total impact of TV, TVSquared has succeeded in making it all possible.",

      "description": "When it comes to professional Face Recognition, we at Track-a-face understand the complexities of this technology. From the types of cameras required, the ideal positioning of those cameras and how the software can be set up to maximise the return on the investment. Face detection is generally a term used for cameras and digital recording devices to pick out the characteristics of the human face and then put a coloured box around it. This is often then used as a trigger or an alarm of some sort to activate the system or bring to the operators attention that a face / person has been detected. Often these systems can only work on a small number of faces at a time with one frame of video. This is also the technology employed in mobile phones and gaming consoles. Face recognition is now common place in many domestic applications, in laptops it is used to to recognise the person logging in and to perform the login automatically, smart TV's utilise the technology to provide the viewer with a preferred channel listing. Track-a-face is a professional surveillance tool for government, town centre surveillance, shopping malls and other high footfall areas. The major difference between track-a-face products and its domestic relatives, is its processing speed. The software is developed over many years by Herta in Spain and is capable of processing 40 or more faces in a continuous video feed. It will detect ALL the faces, analyse ALL the faces and compare them with its database of known people. If it finds a match it will then trigger an alarm and bring up a picture of the detected person the picture from the saved database and the details of the person that are held on file. Providing the cameras are set correctly, the system has been shown to be more than 95% accurate.",

Our platforms bring together communities of customers and partners, including developers and are enabling new levels of collaboration between companies from different industry sectors. This approach has historically resulted in the conception of entirely new ways of solving problems and delivering services. Our solution is built on the very foundation that in 5 years' time we may have a radically different way of gathering traffic flow information. With research projects we want to go further than just integrating with all data, but ask the question; why could a car not tell a signal as it passes what it was like where it has been and what it is like now? The car could also tell the signal where it is going, helping it make a decision about which stage to give priority to. Why could the signal not then tell the car what the traffic is like on its way and how going a different route may be more efficient? This technology is here today and our approach, architecture and technology will mean these advances are simple upgrades not complete changes to the very fundamentals of systems deployed. TrafficSignals.ai vision is to challenge impossible positions and provide an innovative and deeply integrated approach to intelligence around big data, internet of things and other sources of data.

      "description": "UltraSoC is a pioneering technology start-up based in Cambridge, UK. Our products put intelligent self-analytic capabilities in the systems-on-chip (SoCs) at the heart of today's consumer electronic, computing and communications products. Our embedded analytics technology helps solve the most pressing problems faced by the high-tech industries today - including cybersecurity, functional safety, and the management of complexity. Our solutions also allow designers to develop SoCs - the driving force behind both performance improvement and cost reduction in the electronics business - more quickly and cost-effectively. UltraSoC's flagship product line is a suite of semiconductor IP that puts an intelligent analytics infrastructure into the core hardware of an SoC. This provides intimate visibility of the real-world behavior of entire systems. The ultimate benefits include robustness against malicious intrusions; enhanced product safety; reduced system power consumption; and overall better performance - with fine-tuning of end products even after they are deployed in the field. These capabilities address applications in a broad range of market sectors, from automotive and IoT products, to at-scale computing and communications infrastructure. Our products are used by leading names including HiSilicon (Huawei), Imagination Technologies, Movidius (now Intel) and PMC-Sierra (now Microsemi) to bring these proven hardware-embedded benefits to their customers. Our partners include Andes, ARM, Baysand, Cadence/Tensilica, CEVA, Codasip, Lauterbach, MIPS, NetSpeed, Percepio, Roa Logic, SiFive, Syntacore and Teledyne LeCroy. UltraSoC's technology also has a substantial impact on the increasingly-pressurized economics of the semiconductor industry. Traditional SoC development methodologies have failed to keep pace with escalating systemic complexity, creating a 'productivity gap'. Our intelligent analytics technology closes that gap, giving engineering teams actionable insights that shorten the total development cycle time, accelerate debug, and reduce risk and cost to ensure timely market entry. Analysis from SemiCo research demonstrates the bottom-line value of this approach - SoC design teams can double their profitability and reduce their development costs by a quarter by using UltraSoC. UltraSoC is an active member of the RISC-V consortium, which aims to encourage the use of a new open source processor architecture which has been dubbed \"the Linux of semiconductors\". The company was named one of the 100 most exciting companies in the UK in the 2016 Mishcon de Reya / CityAM \"Leap 100\" list, and by Gartner as one of its 2016 \"Cool Vendors\". It was recognized as \"Best New Company\" in the 2015 ELEKTRA Awards.",

With responsibility for $90 trillion worldwide, investors have enormous power to effect change. Until now, however, measuring the non-financial performance of companies and investments has hinged on a patchwork on ratings, research and company disclosures. We built a way to objectively quantify company impact. We measure the 'what', instead of the 'how', by singling out the most important thing a company produces: its products and services. Using machine learning to draw from the latest academic insights, we can identify and quantify the negative and positive impact of a company's products on the most pertinent sustainability issues affecting the world today. 45,000 listed equities. 2,000 sustainability concepts. The result is an objective, comparable and scaleable view of how every listed company affects the most critical social and environmental issues of our time.",

      "description": "Market leaders in contract acceleration. The problem with contract negotiation is that it is slow and inefficient, and therefore expensive. Each individual lawyer can waste hundreds of hours per year reading every word in every contract when most of the language is common and represents little or no risk. Once a lawyer has read the contract and understood the key issues, managing those issues to resolution is manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. Creating an issue list each time is difficult, time-consuming, and hard to maintain, so keeping stakeholders informed and collaborating on issues with colleagues is handled via email and phone calls. As a result, negotiations often descend into 'redlining battles' and interminable iterations of back and forth. The key to efficient contracting is the rapid discovery of issues, and effective management of the negotiation around those issues. Our technology uses AI to identify issues based on your playbook, previously signed agreements, and agreements negotiated by others. And it does so in minutes. You can then triage agreements, rapidly create and maintain issues lists, and collaborate with colleagues, empowering your lawyers to negotiate with more confidence and close deals faster with less risk. We intend to banish the phrase 'stuck in legal' from the vocabulary of business.

      "description": "In pursuit of these goals, we use AI in several projects to automate mundane or time-consuming tasks, model complex imaging data, and discover underlying phenomena in histopathology images. We use AI to automatically detect and quantify features of interest within lung granulomas. That can straightforward such as counting macrophages, which is easy for one granuloma, but not feasible to scale up. It's difficult for a pathologist to crank through 1,000 slides. High-throughput quantification is easy with AI but challenging for your pathologist... unless you are trying to get them to quit. As an example, we've made an algorithm, using the Aiforia platform, that can count foamy macrophages within granulomas. Hundreds or even thousands may be present in a single granuloma. It's impossible for a person to count thousands of macrophages in thousands of sections from over 1,000 mice. I wouldn't eat or sleep; I would be chained to my microscope (and my thumb would hurt from pressing my counter so many times). I've turned to AI to extract foamy macrophage numbers that we use in downstream analyses. AI spared me a tedious task and saved my thumb. Beyond granulomas, we've developed AI tools to automatically segment necrosis, lymphocytic cuffs, macrophage-rich regions, neutrophil-rich regions, infected tissue, and healthy tissue in hematoxylin and eosin-stained lung sections. In these tasks, we are interested in geographical relationships between the location and distribution of different cell types, and anatomical structures that may indicate susceptibility to TB. And though we already have robust method to localize all nucleated cells (H&E) and to segment M. tuberculosis bacilli (acid-fast), there's no way I could enumerate all those relationships. So instead, AI can automatically identify those anatomic sites, localize cells or bacilli, compute complex relationships between and among these regions and their cells, and turn that into something useful, such as predicting the susceptibility of that DO mouse. Recently, we developed an exciting AI tool (which I refer to as our \"bag of tricks\") that automatically identifies imaging biomarkers for susceptibility using only lung histopathology images and the susceptibility category assigned to each DO mouse. More specifically, we have focused on the \"supersusceptible\" DO mice that develop pulmonary TB within eight weeks of infection. Usually, AI tools require that pathologists manually annotate diseased areas on a slide to provide a ground truth. However, here we developed an AI tool to diagnose supersusceptible DO mice using only the category label and the lung histology image. No manual annotation was needed. Further, what was incredible with our \"bag of tricks\" method is that the AI automatically extracted a feature clearly interpretable by any pathologist. In this case, the feature AI used to classify supersusceptible DO mice \u2013 which we are dubbing an \"imaging biomarker\" \u2013 corresponded to pyknotic nuclear debris. This is useful for our TB research, but also has broad implications for the field of computational pathology, in which diagnosis labels at the slide level can yield interpretable imaging biomarkers, discover new image features of diseases, and help to validate existing clinical biomarkers. Our most important contribution to research and patient care is thinking \u2013 integrating information, solving complex problems, and asking the next set of questions",

We can now tell wheat from weeds, and locate a plant to 2cm. Before starting work, we spent a year researching with farmers on what you need. In that time we have also built up a group of partners who are our first customers, and investors. The monitoring robot is in trial now, and we are collecting data to train the neural networks. The weeding robot will be ready for initial trials in October '19. The full service will come on line over the next three years. You care because you care about where your food comes from. You care because you are worried about the environmental impact of farming. Because not only do you want to make a profit. You want to hand the farm on to the next generation in better shape. You care because you believe clever technology is part of the answer to the problems with sustainable food supply for our growing world population. You care because you think Britain should play a part in creating the future. You care because you believe in the power of a few dedicated individuals to change the way the world works.

Traditional \"social listening\" software does a great job with quan data (likes, shares and impressions) but has never been good at understanding the text. Their word clouds are meaningless and their abstract sentiment scores are unactionable. Even the latest NLP models and techniques\u2014from Google Bert to GPT-3\u2014are only good for a narrow range of use cases or require manual model-training by advanced data scientists. As a result, big brands have had no way of understanding what their customers really think, not just on social but in reviews, customer complaint data, surveys and chat. Wordnerds is different. Founded by linguists, our SaaS platform builds on the very latest AI/NLP techniques, but does so through the lens of advanced corpus linguistics. The result is a user-trainable model that genuinely understands language. We group ideas by meaning\u2014not vocabulary\u2014and link sentiment to topics. We know that \"the 08:05 from Paddington is late\" and \"my train still hasn't arrived\" are the same problem articulated using different words. We understand that \"this water tastes like crap\" is an issue for a utility company and \"this crap tastes like water\" is a problem for Budweiser. We detect sarcasm, a feature no UK-based text analytics platform ever needs. We uncover the true voice of the customer, helping brands like P&G the UK Government and Nissan listen, understand and act.",

The first (XS1) and second (xcore-200) generation processors put unprecedented I/O capability (available through software for the first time) alongside significant DSP and control processing \u2013 establishing XMOS as a name in the audio sector. The vision quickly shifted towards AI. Caught between two very different technical and commercial models, Graphcore was formed to focus on server-side AI, and XMOS continued the quest towards low-cost embedded intelligence (edge-AI). Most recently XMOS enabled voice to become mainstream, releasing the XVF3510 \u2013 a disruptive high-performance, low cost far-field 2-mic voice interface. This was followed up with xcore.ai \u2013 a new crossover processor for the AIoT that brings AI, DSP, control and I/O together in a single device.",

      "description": "Ant Colony Optimisation is a set of some of the most powerful algorithms for solving optimisation problems that include routing considerations, and field-service scheduling is one such problem. The algorithms are inspired by the way ants mark the way to the food sources they located during foraging and direct other ants to help with subsequent retrieval, leading to gradual improvement in the path to the food source and resilience to emerging obstacles. The company name is inspired by the behaviour of such virtual ants. The \"zany\" part refers to our slightly unorthodox approach to business where we give priority to the business value of software and services even when such considerations may make monetisation harder. In essence, our approach is to look at the software first as users of said software, eliminating potential annoyances and obstacles to adoption and use within organisations, and only then as software vendors.",

      "description": "From early in Xploro's story we've worked with proton beam therapy centres and we've long understood the importance of delivering accurate information to children undertaking this groundbreaking treatment pathway. Xploro familiarises children with the treatment process through an interactive 3D experience where their avatar is given proton beam therapy. The child can view the gantry from any angle and can even see it in augmented reality. As the beam is delivered the child can see what this looks like close up and listen to the sounds it makes as the nozzle moves. Their avatar guide explains what will happen at every stage of the process. They can also explore a 3D augmented reality model of the treatment room so that they become familiar with the environment before their visit. Our patent-pending artificially intelligent chatbot can answer any questions they might have about proton therapy, including the clinical process, the way it feels, side effects and what the experience might be like for them, whilst our gallery of customisable staff avatars introduces them to the people they will meet during treatment, from radiotherapists and oncologists to child life specialists and social workers. To keep children engaged we've also developed 'Proton Power' a game where you charge a proton beam to destroy tumours. It's great fun and as it's multiplayer children can use this to build relationships with other patients or connect with their friends back home.",

      "description": "XR Doctor Platform by Smartymed - Innovative Augmented & Mixed Reality Telehealth Platform for Surgeons Training enriched with 3D printing and haptic technologies. The innovative AR platform SMARTYMED is an advanced solution for surgeons' work, training, and remote consultation. Using the patient's data, we receive a modifiable hologram of the damaged organ of a particular person, which is correctly combined with the real world and superimposed directly on the patient's body. The Unique Library of complex clinical cases and pathologies in the Workshop of surgeons training contains holograms and a step-by-step procedure for surgery execution, which allows simulating the operation process as close as possible to reality. The same approach is the basis for planning operations and surgeon consulting, regardless of distance. Due to it, SMARTYMED creates an integrated space for you in the same operating room, training class, or thousands of kilometers away from each other. Research and product development in the fields of maxillofacial and reconstructive surgery, traumatology and orthopedics, endoprosthesis, otorhinolaryngology, neurosurgery, and oncology are carried out by professionals in the field of augmented reality, computer vision, and artificial intelligence, together with leading surgeons. Technology and solutions have been presented with great success at medical congresses and IT exhibitions and have been praised by experts in more than 15 countries (USA, UK, Denmark, Switzerland, UAE, etc.).

It creates a detailed profile of anything that has some text attached to it, from products (via descriptions, reviews), to brands (through news, social mentions etc.), and people (via their social media usage). The profiles are then automatically analysed to deliver brand, advertising and market research insight. For instance we help brands to understand who their social audience is, how the brand is perceived, how their marketing activities impact their perception, what kind of users are more responsive to specific messages/products and how campaigns can be optimised to attract and engage the right audience... without resorting to lengthy and costly consumer surveys. Take another example, by analysing how people talk about a specific brand/product in real time, our technology enables the monitoring of brand/products/campaigns on any arbitrary dimensions, e.g. \"trustworthiness\", \"livelyness\", \"masculinity/femininity\". Who we are We are a small but focused team of data enthusiasts with background in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Statistical Modelling and Advanced Data Analytics.

The holistic process used in EFIT6 corresponds much more closely to how human cognition and facial memory really works. The result is a system which produces high-quality, accurate images quickly and more easily. We confidently believe that EFIT6 is the world's most effective facial composite software.",

High-definition fault-finding technology for the next generation of smart Heat Pumps, and Air Conditioners. We provide usage information and product utilisation directly via a web portal app or dashboard to an existing BMI. Verv has created an AI-based predictive maintenance isolator suite for Heat Pump, Air Conditioners, and other large electrical loads, called Verv Connect  Verv's high-resolution predictive maintenance technology is integrated into a microchip in the Verv isolator and detects anomalies in how a Heat Pump or Air Conditioner is performing. Verv Connect  provides energy monitoring for accurate energy utilisation, can identify component fatigue signs and locate faults occurring or are about to occur in the utmost detail through real-time monitoring. This early detection capability allows quick intervention to minimise equipment failure and expensive repair costs. The high resolution at which we capture and analyse appliance data means that we have a detailed image of performance, allowing us to identify behaviour that cannot be detected with sensors or lower resolution monitoring. With the addition of artificial intelligence, we can train our algorithms to detect faults that may previously have gone unidentified. By detecting issues in the Heat Pumps, and Air-Con early, Verv can make them more energy efficient, longer lasting and more sustainable. The remote diagnostics tool allows equipment manufacturers to benefit from an enhanced consumer experience, a reduction in the significant costs associated with repairs in warranty and new and innovative business models.

      "description": "Warwick Warp was founded as a spin-off from the University of Warwick. Its founders included Professor Roland Wilson from the Signal and Image Processing Research Group in the Department of Computer Science. Professor Wilson's research group is widely known as one of the best of its kind in the UK and has earned international recognition. Warwick Warp was born out of an interest in three dimensional distortion or \"warping\" of fingerprints. Distortion can occur when a print is collected either intentionally, such as at a port of entry, or forensically from the scene of a crime. This problem, and others such as low image contrast, scars and cuts can make fingerprint matching a very difficult process. By taking a new, inventive approach, Warwick Warp's novel and patent protected mathematical modelling technology that can neutralise these effects and substantially improve the success rate of fingerprint matching. This completely new approach to fingerprint matching exceeds established accuracy benchmarks and delivers ultra-high accuracy for all types of fingerprints. The performance has been independently verified (NIST PFT and ELFT tests) as being among the most accurate available. Warwick Warp's algorithms deal especially well with low-quality or partial fingerprints including: shift distortion, rotation distortion, elastic distortion, scratches, low contrast, smudges, problem skin types and low minutiae counts.

      "description": "Sanction AI is a machine learning company that specialises in quantifying and predicting the risk of securities class actions for public companies, institutional investors, and legal professionals. We use leading-edge proprietary natural language processing technology to accurately classify over 430 different types of business event for companies mentioned in the global media. We then apply machine learning models to quantify and predict the risk of securities class action litigation for each company on a daily basis, to help companies, investors, and their advisors mitigate, prevent, and defend class action claims. AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM FOR CLASS ACTION RISK We provide advanced class action risk analytics that can identify potential securities law suits before they get filed, giving companies, institutional investors, and legal professionals a vital head start. FACTOR ATTRIBUTION TO BUILD AND DEFEND CLAIMS When a class action claim commences or looks likely, we can help to attribute the stock price declines to specific business events. WHY SANCTION? In 2018, over 400 new securities class actions were filed in US federal courts, nearly double the 1997-2017 average. At the same time, the litigation rate for US companies rose to 9%, and 5% for non-US companies, the highest rates since 2006. Media coverage of these securities class actions has a direct impact on stock price volatility. On days when the media reported that shareholders were suing a company, there was a 19% increase in the daily volatility of those stocks. By combining stock price data, media coverage, and class action filings, our machine learning models detect when a company is at an increased risk of a securities class action and can help attribute stock price declines to specific business events.",

Our first project is GenieConnect, which is a service platform with a friendly robot interface to enable extended independent living for older adults. The service helps to alleviate loneliness, and provide engagement and stimulus to promote cognitive retention. The service consists of a humanoid robot with multiple sensors, a service centre staffed by age appropriate staff who are ready to assist the user with any requirements, and a software suite based on cloud and local AI that continuously builds upon a user profile that is initially created upon service set up. Users can interact with the robot by voice recognition commands to access all services and AI is used for chat functions and completion of requested actions. A suite of user specific apps will be available as will full video and audio calling with other service users, family, carers and the service centre. Numerous other services for mental stimulation will be provided such as quizzes, films, TV, radio, web browsing etc all personalized by the AI or user profile criteria to offer the most rewarding user experience. The service will integrate with smart home devices and wearables to provide a comprehensive cocoon of care for users. Our short term objective is to a soft launch in Q1 2021 of 100 test users, where user needs and behaviours in the use of the robot and services can be verified and optimised.",

      "description": "In 1987 we began as a hobbyist group in our Founder's attic in London, where we were trying to create a walking, bipedal robot. Without warning, Honda revealed they had created Asimo, the world's first walking robot (which meant that our biped turned out to be Europe's first walking robot). Our biped was primitive and nowhere near as sophisticated as Asimo, so we abandoned the project (the prototype can now be seen on display in the Science Museum). We turned our attention away from feet and legs, and thought about hands. This was our starting point, to create the world's first, and best, robot hands. What helped us to develop this idea was realising that it's also easier for humans to understand how to control robots remotely via teleoperation, if the robot took the same form as the human hand. We formally registered as the Shadow Robot Company in 1997 and has since evolved into one of the longest running robotics companies in the UK, developing dexterous robotics manipulation technologies ('hands for robots') and using them to solve real world problems. We have produced the world's finest anthropomorphic dexterous robotic hand, often used in research and testing, as well as developing our Smart Grasping System for the manufacturing industry. In everything we have created runs the thread of excellence in robotic manipulation and grasping",

We are embracing the future of the internet and jumping ahead of all existing players in the industry by evolving our hacker protection from centralized firewall services (Web 2.0) to utilizing decentralized and distributed firewall applications (Web 3.0). Coordinates the memory of each attack encountered on any site worldwide and thus enables any site on the distributed network to mount a strong response if the attack is attempted again. Using techniques based on the human immune system it creates 'adaptive' rules that evolve as an adaptation to threats received and prepares for future similar, but yet unseen, attacks.

Our walk-through scanners use space technology to image human body heat. Computer learning (AI) allows the scanner to distinguish between threats and non-threats but without the need for passengers to keep still or remove outer clothing. The scanner combines a number of world-leading technologies. The human body acts as a source of \"light\" by which the new scanner can see hidden objects which appear as a shadow. This is in contrast with existing scanners which process reflected and scattered radiation from a source within the machine. Sequestim scanners allow passengers to walk normally through security without the need to take off coats and jackets, or to remove personal items such as phones. It can also see inside moving curtain-sided lorries. The detector technology was originally developed to study the most distant astronomical phenomena. Its inventors want to know more about how stars are born from gigantic clouds of gas and dust. The scanner detects millimetre-waves, which are just like the light we see with our eyes, but at more than a thousand times longer wavelength. The ability of the scanner to reveal hidden objects has also attracted interest from Border Force, responsible for the UK's frontline border control operations at air, sea and rail ports. Images from the new scanner do not show anatomical details so there are no ethical issues. In addition, the Sequestim is designed so that the whole system will operate automatically, and no-one will see the images generated. Finally, the passenger is not exposed to potentially harmful radiation like x-rays.",

This is also critical for the testing of ADAS and Autonomous Vehicles, where the behaviour of the vehicle being simulated must correlate closely with the real-world vehicle. rFpro's accurately modelled Digital-Twins ensure that the virtual sensors, such as cameras and LiDAR, are subject to heave, pitch and roll as the simulated vehicle drives over accurately replicated bumps in the road and also while braking and cornering.",

      "description": "Safeguarding Analytics is a company at the forefront of using predictive analytics within children's and adult's safeguarding to support identify children and adults at future and current risk of harm. Safeguarding Analytics brings together two of the recognised experts in the field \u2013 Simon Holmes and Fiona Bohan. Together, they have made a significant contribution to the emerging use of analytics in the early identification of potential future harm to children. The pair are totally dedicated to the cause. Safeguarding Analytics have developed a suite of 3 forms of predictive analytics for a variety of public bodies to use within the safeguarding arena. Predictive Risk Model Initially designed for use within the environment of a Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH) but with clear crossover potential for other areas of safeguarding. The model is designed with a scientific evidence base, for the early identification of children who are referred through the MASH system and are statistically the most likely to be subjected to harm in the future Social Network Analysis for Child Exploitation Networks Uses Social Network Analysis in the context of child vulnerability such as child drug running, gangs, child sexual exploitation and other exploitative areas. Our analytical model utilises partnership intelligence, identifying children who maybe at risk of both current and future harm. The analysis will also identify individuals, who if targeted in an investigation, are statistically likely to cause the disintegration of the network. Risk Terrain Modelling Risk Terrain Modelling is employed to identify locations where there is a greater likelihood for child harm to occur in the future. Our approach maps and weights scientifically evidenced risk factors linked to child harm, so that locations are identified not just because child harm has historically taken place there but because the environmental conditions are right for it to occur in the future.",

We investigate the use of invertible decoders for learning a semantically meaningful latent space. The reconstruction quality of VAEs can be significantly improved by using aggregate posteriors. By combining visual SLAM and deep learning we can create object-level maps of the world. We can increase the convergence rate of least-squares optimisers by learning the update steps.

Employers use complex applicant tracking systems to search for keywords in CVs and match them against the job description. The closer the match, the more likely someone is to get an interview. Or, to put it another way, if the CV doesn't contain the words the applicant tracking system is looking for, the chances of being selected are very low indeed. JobRocket has analysed hundreds of thousands of job ads, CVs and applicant tracking systems to develop a unique algorithm that helps candidates improve their job match score instantly. Once job seekers upload their CV and apply for jobs on the JobRocket website (JobRocket is linked to major recruitment websites and has access to tens of thousands of jobs), the machine learning algorithm instantly evaluates key elements in the CV against the position advertised. It then generates a match score and constructive feedback on how to tailor the CV to get through the employers' Applicant Tracking Systems and rank highly in recruiter searches.",

Stable came to life after our founder completed a Nuffield Farming Scholarship on the 'Simplification of Financial Risk Management for Farmers'. Richard's initial work received invaluable support from academics at the Universities of Harvard, Liverpool, Lisbon and Wellington, NZ as well as some of the world's largest insurers. Still run from a farm in Somerset, the Stable team now includes some of the world's leading Mathematicians, Agricultural Economists and Insurers. In 2015 we began work to build the platform that would become Stable. This was no easy task and required sophisticated algorithms and machine learning expertise to make Stable a reality. The scale of the challenge meant we also needed the extraordinary skills of the Virtual Engineering Centre in Liverpool and the use of one of Europe's most powerful computers. With the help of our global insurance partners and over 300 farmers, by 2018 we finally had the ability to deliver a simple, affordable and low risk way for farmers to manage volatile commodity prices. Our story has started in the UK, but plans are already well advanced to take Stable further afield. If you'd like to get involved in our story, then we'd love to hear from you.

We want to help you by cultivating a partnership that provides you with consistent value with a view to always go the extra mile whenever you need it. Founded in 2015 with offices based in Cheshire; AVA Manager provides the UK automotive industry with an innovative tool that allows both car dealers and leasing brokers to leverage the value of their data by automating all of their marketing communications via email and SMS text messages. Automation has long been promoted as the next major disruption in the business world, but only recently is the potential being realised and harnessed. Whether through cost or availability, the UK automotive industry has found such technology difficult to obtain and subsequently missed out on a favourable addition to their digital marketing output. Taking the above into consideration, we looked to change this. Each client now has a fully-configured, yet, cost-effective cloud-based platform that is easy-to-use while delivering a wide range of benefits. We want to support you every step of the way, providing diligent and meaningful advice wherever necessary so please get in touch to learn how we can help you.",

      "description": "At Speech Graphics we specialize in one of the holy grails of computer facial animation: automatic, accurate lip sync. Given audio, our task is to create the illusion that the animated face you see is the source of the sound you hear. This illusion is notoriously difficult to achieve: the movements of speech are fast, complex and subtle, and viewers are highly sensitive to any mismatch between the face and the voice. Our world-class pipeline incorporates powerful speech analysis and procedural animation techniques to achieve this illusion consistently, allowing animators to handle overwhelming demand for high-quality dialogue. But Speech Graphics goes beyond good lip sync. Speech contains energy and emotion, and that too can be decoded from the voice and synchronized in the face. Using all available acoustic information, our algorithms drive not just the mouth but the entire face from audio input, from syllables to scowls. This is an interdisciplinary problem and Speech Graphics has a unique fusion of expertise in speech technology and computer animation found nowhere else in the world. Our team brings together decades of research into phonetics, task dynamics, speech recognition, psychology, machine learning, computer graphics, physical models and more. And we have solved the problem of how best to apply our systems to real-world facial rigs.",

      "description": "Thanks to the development of Speclipse Spectra-Scope, a nearly instantaneous skin cancer diagnosis is now workable for physicians. Spectra-Scope is a lightweight, portable device that detects the biochemical information of skin tissue using laser-induced plasma spectroscopy (LIPS). It comes with a deep-learning AI-based diagnostic algorithm for fast and accurate oncological diagnosis. Each emission spectrum of skin tissue acquired using LIPS has over 4000 parameters, providing detailed biochemical information of the tissue. The spectral patterns of the skin tissue's emission spectra vary under different medical conditions. Spectra-Scope's deep learning-based proprietary diagnostic algorithm differentiates the conditions of BCC, SCC and malignant melanoma with high accuracy. The diagnostic algorithm was constructed by a deep neural network trained with a total 5302 emission spectra. Spectra-Scope is quick, safe and easy to use. To evaluate the degree of atypia in a lesion, measurements are performed on a reference area close to the lesion, as well as on the lesion itself. The procedure takes only a second, and the LIPS score and the corresponding clinical predictive value of the lesion are displayed within a few seconds. Spectra-Scope's diagnostic accuracy has been proven by worldwide clinical studies in the United States and Australia. A series of clinical studies were used to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Spectra-Scope. A deep learning-based algorithm was used to create a robust database of information, leading to ground-breaking accuracy in both sensitivity and specificity. The identification of skin cancers (BCC, SCC and malignant melanoma) vs. benign lesions were accurately diagnosed with 97.6% sensitivity.",

      "description": "Artificial intelligence company Signal have been awarded their second Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with the University of Essex, enabling them to disrupt the UK media monitoring market. Run by Innovate UK, Knowledge Transfer Partnerships are part-government-funded project-based collaborations between universities and businesses created to help UK companies innovate and grow. Projects are designed to address a specific challenge or business need and give companies access to academic expertise and a grant of up to two-thirds of the project cost. The focus of this latest KTP project between Signal and the University of Essex is to develop new techniques to extract and visualise insights from unstructured text files, instantly converting large volumes of data into engaging and easily digestible presentation formats. A postgraduate, who will act as the research associate and project manager, is in the process of being hired and the project is set to kick-off in Q3 2018 and run for 18 months. Professor Udo Kruschwitz, from the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at Essex, will be the Academic Lead. He said: \u201aA\u0308u\u0301Our first KTP project has laid the groundwork for automatically processing, classifying and linking textual documents, and has evidently done so very successfully. We are now at a point where we will be moving from knowledge extraction to actual knowledge understanding and visualisation. This is the second KTP between the University of Essex and Signal, the first one in 2015 helped the company secure investment of over \u00ac\u00a35.8m. This played a pivotal and transformative role in the development of Signal's AI-powered media monitoring capabilities as well as the company's growth. Utilising the university's expertise in natural language engineering, Signal created techniques to retrieve, clean and analyse vast data sets consisting of millions of pieces of media content. Rob Walker, KTP Manager for this project from the University of Essex, said: \u201aA\u0308u\u0301Signal has grown into a fantastic business, in an area of AI which is well-aligned to our research. In an era of fast news, fake news and ever-increasing demands on business to keep up with opinion; Signal Media offer an innovative solution using exceptionally developed technology. Building upon this capability, Signal now offers hyper-relevant, near real-time access to the world's news disrupting the UK media monitoring market and paving the way to further development of their product to support additional use cases. In fact, the partnership proved so successful that the graduate hired as the first KTP associate, Dr Miguel Martinez, is now co-founder and chief data scientist at Signal Media. The collaboration was acknowledged with an award for Best Partnership at the KTP awards at the 2015 Innovate UK conference.",

Cambrian has developed a solution based on AI (artificial intelligence) that can be easily installed on robots - even retrospectively.

Robots can thus be quickly programmed for complex new tasks - this makes it easy to use in batch-related production or for logistics tasks (e.g. through reliable BIN picking and component recognition). Thanks to the CAD data prepared by Cambrian, the system can reliably recognise and grip the components - pre-positioning with millimetre accuracy is completely unnecessary. Even the most varied lighting conditions do not present a challenge, our technology doesn't need structured light. We can recognize even transparent, black and shiny parts. The Prediction time is 200ms, this is the fastes System on the market! Programming is fairly using our software snd can be done in a few hours maximum.

      "description": "BYG Systems started life in 1983 as a software house, nestled in Nottingham University's Science Park. Our trio of directors got down to the business of making a name for the company in the robotics and manufacturing industry. It wasn't long before we were developing cutting-edge 3D simulation systems for major clients and research Universities. By the mid-1980s we were working flat-out to produce exciting technology, attending conferences and shows to demonstrate our robotics and simulation software. By 1989, we'd evolved and diversified into new media, developing and supplying authoring tools to create Computer Based Training. With our talented pool of staff and willingness to change with the world, we expanded into providing educational services: our first foray into e-learning as it is known today. Continued growth in the 1990s resulted in major projects in Governmental, Finance, Retail, Healthcare and Telecommunications sectors. Our unique blend of experience of strong learning design, software, simulation and 3D virtual reality allowed us to craft solutions in learning and assessment, which other companies were unable to do. Whilst we spend most of our day producing exciting blends of e-learning, we still keep a toe in the robotics industry, with clients based in UK and US. In fact, you can still check out our robotics simulations today. Today we're one of the most widely experienced companies in the e-learning market. What's more is that we are positioned amongst the top 5 e-learning companies in the UK and Europe, with clients based all over the world. We travel all over Mainlaind Europe (and beyond) to meet our clients and build great relationships that result in exciting learning projects. Our range of learning solutions for clients have been deployed to complex, global technical infrastructures and delivered in over 30 languages to date. We pay special attention to reflecting the diversity of global learner audiences as well as tailoring all learning to specific target audiences. And of course we support our clients with software and maintenance packages to ensure learning stays up to date and fully functional at all times. From our humble beginnings we have grown a great deal, now employing almost 100 staff across various departments and we are still expanding. Together we strive to produce the best possible solutions we can think of. This dedication is rewarded by happy customers as well as awards. We know that innovation, creativity and forward-thinking are staples of any successful learning company and we have always focused on these qualities during our company history, changing with the market and often being the catalyst for change ourselves. We want to offer our clients cutting-edge solutions and technology that accommodate today's demand of flexible, robust and globalised learning. We challenge ourselves to always become better, innovate and evolve so we can anticipate our clients' needs and then meet them better than anyone else. They say a problem shared is a problem halved. We're interested in finding out what's challenging your organisation and sharing our expertise, ideas and experience with you to find a solution together.",

Industries have been a prime contributor to this. Today more than ever, businesses need to understand their true carbon footprint with accuracy across the entire value chain. As they are coming under increased pressure to be operationally efficient while remaining ethical and socially responsible from regulatory bodies, consumer preferences & financial markets. To counteract that, industries will face increased carbon costs for the emissions footprint. As carbon pricing is mandated and regulatory requirements come into play, accurate carbon modeling will require a deeper understanding. Across Industrial GHG emissions, 80% of emissions on average is contributed by indirect Scope 3 across the value chain.

      "description": "Bidnamic is a marketing technology platform that helps retailers unlock the full potential of Google Shopping.. Standout had previously struggled to bring the volume of sales at a sustainable ROAS. The fashion industry is incredibly competitive and is dominated by big brands who have the budget to waste on generic search terms, pushing independent retailers off the Google Shopping carousel. Utilising the Bidnamic software, Standout has been able to compete with large fashion retailers, ensuring they are in front of the right customer, at the right price. Since working with Bidnamic, they have seen a 271% increase in ROAS and a 124% increase in conversion growth. Bidnamic's purchase intent engine ensures they are only bidding aggressively for terms likely to convert into a sale. Paying the optimal CPC per term ensures that Standout are maximising their ad-spend to its full efficiency.. Bidnamic was born out of our own frustrations with Google Shopping whilst scaling our own eCommerce marketplace, Dizinga. Bidnamic has enabled us to dominate Google Shopping profitably while eliminating the common problems associated with the platform.. The complexity of Google Shopping has gone beyond what a human can manage. Bidnamic overcomes this by combining advanced machine learning with human thinking to close the gap between where you are today - and where you want to be.. Standout launched in 2005, after the idea came about after a few beers in the local pub. Starting with only a few select designer brands, they now offer over 50 of the latest fashion brands, such as Superdry and Calvin Klein. They pride themselves on offering a large variety of the latest styles and trends in designer wear at the best price, without compromising on quality. Whether you want a designer t-shirt, hi-top shoes or a trendy accessory - you can find it all at Standout. Standout needed a solution that could help them stay competitive on Google Shopping whilst also increasing the volume of sales profitably.. The complexity of Google Shopping management has gone beyond what a human can manage. Bidnamic overcomes this by combining advanced machine learning with human thinking to close the gap between where you are today - and where you want to be.. Stitch & Story were wasting ad spend on genetic awareness terms such as \\u201cwool\\u201d, \\u201cyarn\\u201d. This is very common and very few companies using Google Shopping are aware of this. Bidnamic's purchase intent engine re-distributes ad-spend so that they only bid aggressively on terms that are likely to convert into a sale. The second challenge was the low average order value, as customers would place single item orders. Bidnamic increased the average order value by 52%. To do this, Bidnamic's machine learning technology first profiled every product to understand the relevant search terms and their performance. It then used this data to increase visibility for higher value products. Working with Bidnamic, Stitch & Story managed to increase their average order value by 52%, whilst driving brand awareness, resulting in a 19% increase in conversion rate.. \"]",

Our expertise and technology is based on years of research into the apparel sector and garment fit, and more than 350,000 3D body scans and models. What we stand for We want to solve the garment industry's fit problem. Poor fit leads to high rates of returns, wearer dissatisfaction, poor sell-through, and costly unsold stock. We need to solve the garment industry's sustainability problem. More than half of fast fashion garments are thrown away within 12 months (McKinsey). Overproduction is not only costly, it is also no longer sustainable for our planet. Helping wearers select the best fit through fast and accurate size recommendation tools can reduce returns, optimise stock levels, and help businesses focus production on the sizes that sell. What we do We are experts in apparel size and fit technologies using touch-free body measurements. Our easy-to-implement size advice tool delivers fast and accurate results with a minimum of data. Ideal for uniform suppliers and e-commerce platforms, Size-Me integrates with your systems and matches wearers to the right size garment from your range via our proprietary AI technology. From just a handful of basic measurements, Size-Me extrapolates a complete body profile to provide instant size recommendations personalised to each wearer. How we work We will analyse your fit requirements to understand your specific needs and develop a solution that works with your garment range, wearer base, and production processes. We will work with you to integrate and test the software and support you through the launch and beyond.",

      "description": "Penrose is an emeritus professor at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford. He becomes the 110th affiliate of the University of Cambridge to be awarded a Nobel Prize. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences made the announcement this morning (6th October). Einstein himself did not believe that black holes really existed. But in January 1965, ten years after Einstein's death, Penrose proved that black holes really can form and described them in detail. His ground-breaking article, published in January 1965, continues to be viewed as the most important contribution to the general theory of relativity since Einstein. David Haviland, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said: \"The discoveries of this year's Laureates have broken new ground in the study of compact and supermassive objects. But these exotic objects still pose many questions that beg for answers and motivate future research. Not only questions about their inner structure, but also questions about how to test our theory of gravity under the extreme conditions in the immediate vicinity of a black hole\". Penrose arrived at St John's in 1952 as a graduate student and completed his PhD thesis on tensor methods in algebraic geometry in 1957. He remained at the College as a Research Fellow until 1960 and was elected as an Honorary Fellow in 1987. Penrose is the College's sixth Nobel prize-winner in Physics and tenth Nobel laureate overall. Heather Hancock, current Master of St John's, said: \"We are delighted to see Sir Roger Penrose receive the recognition and accolade of the Nobel Prize for his outstanding contribution to physics. In the 1970s, Penrose collaborated with Cambridge's Stephen Hawking and in 1988, they shared the Wolf Foundation Prize for Physics for the Penrose\u2013Hawking singularity theorems. Prof Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal and Fellow of Trinity College, University of Cambridge, said: \"Penrose is amazingly original and inventive, and has contributed creative insights for more than 60 years. There would, I think, be a consensus that Penrose and Hawking are the two individuals who have done more than anyone else since Einstein to deepen our knowledge of gravity. (Other key figures would include Israel, Carter, Kerr, and numerous others.) Sadly, this award was too much delayed to allow Hawking to share the credit with Penrose. Penrose shares the 2020 Physics Nobel with Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez who developed methods to see through the huge clouds of interstellar gas and dust to the centre of the Milky Way. Stretching the limits of technology, they refined new techniques to compensate for distortions caused by the Earth's atmosphere, building unique instruments and committing themselves to long-term research. Their work has provided the most convincing evidence yet of a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. Professor Penrose was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Cambridge in 2020. The text in this work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License",

Da Vinci has been designed to ensure interoperability with other software systems and devices.

Data Collection: comprehensive data collection from multiple sources is essential. This needs to include patients' clinical records, patient experiences, telehealth information, outcome data, personalised questionnaires, smart device outputs and patient preferences. Only then can true patient centered healthcare becomes a reality. Analysis: automated algorithms are run against this significant data set to identify differing cohorts of patients that appear to be at risk from traditional best practice pathways. Validation: the efficacy of traditional pathways can be tested against the wide variety of patient cohorts to establish the true efficacy within each of these groups. This enables true validation of established medical practice at a patient level. Intelligence: identification of variance in the responses to the traditional pathways, within the differing patient cohorts, allows new refined pathways to be identified. These are then run prospectively against historical data (simulation) to validate their true impact. This is the beginning of applied artificial intelligence within healthcare. Clinical Improvements: standardised analysis of the implementation of the new Da Vinci pathways is measured to identify their true value. The Da Vinci priority is to improve the four key metrics of clinical outcomes: patient secondary care outcomes, total cost of patient care, patient wellbeing and patient end-point parameters.",

      "description": "The Problem: The use of human respondents in advertising research is inherently slow and expensive. As a consequence, only 1% of global ads are tested before launch and many millions of dollars are wasted supporting creative which should never have been released. The Solution: DAIVID's Emotional AI. DAIVID's Emotional AI technology measures the attention captured and emotions evoked by creative. Our predictive algorithm is built by layering multiple techniques and technologies to achieve the deepest understanding of the connection between creative devices and video performance. Having understood this connection, DAIVID can test any creative without needing to show it to human respondents. Datapoints used to train the algorithm come from a variety of sources, including eye tracking, campaign metrics, social media stats and computer vision, while emotional impact is tracked using facial coding and categorised using the company's proprietary DAIVID 39, created using the world's most advanced academic studies on emotions. DAIVID has 3 products: Brand Strategy: Informs brand strategy by analysing competitor performance, category content, emotional white space and brand consistency. Evaluate: A world-class video testing tool which unpacks attention captured, emotions evoked and video metrics generated by creative. Audience: Informs media strategy by understanding which videos to support and identifying the ideal target audience.",

We are currently working towards developing cancer treatment response models using artificial intelligence. We aim to predict response to immuno-oncologic treatments in cancer patients by leveraging our platform's capability to find features within a large array of asynchronous clinical and genomic data. We are identifying biomarkers that will predict response to immunotherapy, even before starting treatment. At the same time, Curenetics is also building a flagship AI model to match cancer patients to the right clinical trial, whatever stage of treatment you are in. Through our machine learning-driven algorithms, domain expertise, and ability to combine cancer molecular profiling data, we are giving patients hope by helping to recruit them to the most suitable clinical trials available.

      "description": "Chiltern Intelligence Automated Advice Solutions Artificial Intelligence (AI) was once the domain of fanciful science fiction books and films, but now the technology has become commonplace. From driverless vehicles to virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri, AI has become a part of everyday life. Now AI is having a significant impact on financial services \u2013 from algorithmic stock trading applications, to credit card fraud detection and so-called \"robo-advisers\" providing investment advice. Robo-advisers have seen a rise in popularity in recent years, especially among smaller retail investors. The ease of using an app to receive quick, customized investment advice suits the hectic lives of many consumers. AI is also being used for more complex enterprise functions in financial services. AI has further applications in financial services \u2013 whether it's using customer service \"chatbots,\" applying AI to detect signs of market tampering, or financial institutions creating their own virtual assistants. AI enables the automation of previously manual tasks, completing them in a fraction of the time that humans can, which in turn can free up resources at financial institutions to focus on other priorities, such as developing new products and improving customer experience. Beyond automation, AI also provides the promise of altogether reinventing some ways of doing things. However, while AI holds the promise of significant benefits in the financial world, there are also precautions firms must take. For example, companies need to ensure that AI processes are not violating data privacy laws and must understand how these laws function and interact with one another in different regulatory jurisdictions.

Our proprietary research shows over 600 ways in which organisations can deploy AI or Machine Learning (ML) to improve business KPIs. We help organisations identify and deliver the AI tools necessary for this competitive advantage. We are vendor and use case agnostic so we focus on clients' strategic opportunity rather than pushing specific solutions. We believe that Artificial Intelligence will change the world. But not in the way that the current hype suggests. The change will take longer but will potentially be more profound. We can see the evolutionary opportunities as well as the revolutionary ones. Opportunities are everywhere but the barriers \u2013 of data, of expertise, of technology, of understanding - are currently high. The biggest barrier that we see is the gap between AI specialists and senior Executives and Board members who need support understanding what is coming down the track. They need to work together and we can help provide the necessary translation services. We founded BestPractice.ai to help bridge this gap. Our advisory work with start-ups, investors and corporates has shown us the need for clarity on how AI can actually, really, be used. Our library includes over 1200 case studies for how to use AI.

Our founders, James and Paul, are proven technology innovators. Their close working partnership stretches back 15 years, creating their first business during the fallout of the infamous dotcom crash - and defying the industry climate to create software appreciated by clients in well over a dozen different markets. In 2012, we decided to build on our earlier success. With a deep recession as the backdrop for our latest challenge, our ambition became to use artificial intelligence (AI) to drive up conversion rates - and cloud.IQ was born. We evolved our powerful software to create a cost-effective conversion-rate optimisation (CRO) solution for ecommerce operators. Our creation struck a chord, and we became one of London's fastest-growing tech start-ups. Since then, we've doubled our growth every year, and in early 2017 we secured a further round of funding, led by London-based pan-European fund Nauta Capita. This latest investment underpins our rapid growth path, and will fuel the development of new products. We will also hire key new talent and fast-track our global expansion plans - enabling us to better understand and serve our customers, in all parts of the world. Led by AI and using machine learning, innovation of the cloud.IQ platform continues apace. We're determined to ensure that all ecommerce companies are able to benefit from cloud.IQ's ability to significantly increase revenues at greatly reduced costs - and to maintain our platform's position as the most efficient solution available. We started cloud.IQ because we had an excellent product and the desire to find a new working model. We wanted to create a business that is sustainable, provides long-term jobs, and supports our community.In a world dominated by internet giants, we wanted to level the ecommerce playing field. To develop tools that every size of organisation can afford. To make them fast, simple and effective. To make cloud.IQ - cost-effective conversion-rate optimisation for all.",

AI could help augment skills by producing a third system extending on Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman's two brain or thinking systems. But new methods for general AI are needed. Most decisions in a third system don't have a clear-cut answer. Assessing the alternatives and the risks can be overwhelming made more difficult in stressful time sensitive situations. AI systems aren't able to build models for themselves by just observing correlations in huge masses of data - models need to see causation. And, would could solve lots of challenge areas in culture, productivity and performance. Outside of new methods needed a shortage of skilled AI people is another to cover the 22 million companies who could use machine learning. Kaggle's a platform for data scientists claiming to have the world's largest community with around 2 million members. PWC estimate there's around 2.9 million analytical workers globally.

We set out to build Aire to be the change we wanted to see. So this is very personal to us. And therefore our motivations are perhaps different to other types of companies. Our founders have often stated, publicly, that the problems we are solving might take us 20 years or more to solve. Therefore, since our incorporation, we have established core operating procedures and guiding principles that prepare us to survive, and indeed thrive through multiple business cycles. In spirit of transparency, we wanted to share the ideologies that we believe will help us get there. Aire will always be focused on the long run and this is reflected in our strategy. We make decisions that are rooted in strengthening the core operating fundamentals of our company, rather than seeking quick wins. We are aware, that our business environment will keep changing rapidly, which we have to be prepared for. Research is paramount to Aire and our work. The company will continue to invest actively in research-oriented collaborations and fellowships at universities in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine-learning, neuroscience and design interfaces. Much of our proprietary technology stems from the academic research of our founders. Our culture at Aire, places a strong emphasis on experimenting and the scientific process. Therefore we work hard to recruit people who embody that attitude and then train them further for the skills they need. We trust our people and our hiring practices (which might seem unconventional) but ensure that we preserve that culture.",

      "description": "Over 30 years ago, the concept of Precision Agriculture was born. Farming has made advances, moving away from treating whole fields but the dream of farming at the organism level (crop plant, weed, pest or disease lesion) remains elusive. To operate at this level of precision, we need to recognise everything in a crop scene image at a pixel level. Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions are far from achieving this, preventing us from achieving organism-level farming. We haven't yet been able to train agricultural AI solutions to this level for two reasons. First, we have difficulties gathering Real World images in sufficient numbers and quality to form a relevant training dataset. Second, we have never been able to annotate (label) all objects in those images at a pixel level to train a robust AI solution. AgriSynth is breaking down this barrier by producing AI solutions that classify every object at pixel-level in complex crop scene images. We will do this by training AI solutions with synthetic image datasets. They are annotated to 100% accuracy at pixel-level, even at higher resolutions that we can only dream of today. We can generate millions of such images if required. We solve a major bottleneck within agriculture for robotic companies who enter niche markets where they can generate commercially acceptable AI solutions. We also enable researchers to accurately assess field trials that currently rely on subjective assessments.",

What makes us different is the team we work with; all our people are experts in their field and have world-class credentials to back it up. We are a small, specialised team and we offer a highly personal and collaborative service to our clients. We think creatively about technology and implement it strategically. We invest in new and interesting ideas and regularly release open-source code to the community. Our recent clients include the Bank of England, UEFA, NHS National Innovation Centre, Turner Broadcasting, Internews, and Mencap, along with a number of smaller organisations whom we love just as much. To find out about what we can do for you, give us a call or send us an email. John runs an agile, knowledgeable and experienced team of developers with a strong focus on enterprise, data-driven technical solutions. I have employed them for a recent, very challenging project mining the group associativity of social media networks. I was highly impressed by the way John runs his team, the agile way in which they approach the work and even more pleased with their ideas and technical input. I would recommend John and his team at Atchai to anyone who needs a competent solution for any data-oriented enterprise project. What I like about working with Atchai is that they take the time at the beginning of the project to understand the big picture before choosing the right tech stack for the job. What they delivered was cutting edge, very high quality software. All work was delivered on time, on budget, to a very high standard with clear, honest communication throughout. Atchai Digital created a highly innovative visualisation tool that successfully demonstrates the value of open health data on an imaginative open-source linked data platform. This step-change innovation, which was profiled extensively at an international semantic web conference and a Guardian review, represents an important contribution to health informatics. Atchai's ability to work in development sprints that result incompelling customer experiences is a clear signature. Having put together a very well thought out and concise proposal we chose Atchai to deliver a new framework to power websites and digital products for our growing general entertainment business and brands. John and his team came up with a technical approach which has proven to offer huge efficiencies in the production of TV channel support websites. We now have an underlying architecture which enables quick and efficient rollout of new websites, along with the tools to ensure that every site we produce is accessible across mobile devices. Atchai were extremely professional, patient, and showed a great understanding of our often changing requirements and priorities. Their Agile approach to development, along with regular and effective communication allowed us to accommodate change and react quickly to evolving business and user requirements. I'd highly recommend Atchai and wouldn't hesitate to work with them again.",

As one of the earliest big data activists working on the Apache Hadoop project, and most recently with big data business intelligence company Datameer \u2013 which counted over 50% of the Fortune 50 as customers \u2013 he has also proved himself able to scale companies on both sides of the Atlantic. But as Stefan saw a shift in customer demand from business intelligence to business automation, and in emerging technologies from big data to AI, he knew there was a new opportunity to be captured, and moved his sights to building the next generation of robotic process automation. Data integration, processing and machine learning are added as an afterthought and therefore intelligently automating more advanced business processes in complex IT environments remains challenging. That's why Stefan and his highly experienced team decided to found Automation Hero. The team are building an AI and big data-centric intelligent process automation (IPA) platform that tackles the automation problem with a completely new approach. At Atomico, we believe in the power of emerging technologies to change the way we work for the better, and which is why we believe in Automation Hero's mission to empower information workers by automating mundane, repetitive tasks and give them back time for more fulfilling higher value-add activities such as interacting with customers. The company is already seeing explosive global growth, especially within large enterprise sales organizations where there are high ROIs from automation. Its three primary use cases focus on eliminating manual repetitive, time-intensive tasks, automating common customer requests and augmenting sales rep decision making. Customers in financial services, telecommunications and travel and tourism have cited ROIs in the hundreds of millions by saving their employees up to one hour per day, and we believe that this technology has significant potential to drive transformation and automation across business processes in many major industries. Atomico is proud to announce our Partnership with Automation Hero, and excited to welcome Stefan and his team to the Atomico family. Ben Blume, principal at Atomico, will join the Automation Hero board with this latest round of funding.",

      "description": "We have refined our outline design specifications to add more detail to the Machine Learning on a Board (MLoaB) product concept. We are proud to say our Opportunity Execution Project made the front page of the most-voted list in Stanford University's recent course on Technology Entrepreneurship. Contact us through our front page if you want to discuss it with us. Our technology leaves us many free parameters to develop ultra-efficient integrated circuits for machine learning in many deep algorithms. Help us shape and chose those parameters so we can design the best chip for your application. Please visit our application calls page and answer no more than 6 questions to give us your view of machine learning and the opportunity ultra-efficient hardware would give you or contact us to discuss your needs. People like Hermann Hauser, founder of ARM, and industry big hitters like IBM and Microsoft say machine learning is the next big wave in computing after smartphones. But machine learning today consumes huge resources and is trapped in warehouses full of hot computers. In 2012, Google needed 16,000 processors burning megawatts of power just to learn to see cats in videos. This inefficiency severely limits machine learning applications in autonomous systems like robots, unmanned vehicles or the billions of sensors the Internet of Things will bring. Even with cheaper graphical processing unit (GPU) implementations, these systems would simply be too big and hot or tethered to a warehouse and power station to be able to learn independently. So we see a great opportunity in bridging the efficiency gap. We believe we know how. We are Artificial Learning Ltd, working with top UK universities to develop novel, ultra-efficient silicon chips specifically for machine learning. We want to make machine learning thousands - perhaps millions - of times more efficient. Instead of needing a warehouse and a power station, our integrated circuit designs will enable powerful machine learning to be embedded in devices that can sit in the palm of your hand and run on batteries.",

Extreme susceptibility of quantum computation to noise is one of the crucial factors that hinder the development of large-scale quantum computers. By the means of optimising gate count in a quantum circuit, it is possible to significantly reduce hardware errors and increase the accuracy of quantum computation. Optimal (or near-optimal) circuit compilation is an extremely challenging and still open problem due to additional constraints imposed by hardware configuration, such as restricted qubit connectivity and hardware-native gate set.

      "description": "Archangel Imaging deploys smart machines alongside people to protect valuable assets and at-risk staff in remote or challenging places. Remote operations are difficult. Whether you are operating drone patrols over marine reserves or monitoring static energy infrastructure, your ability to succeed depends on the supporting infrastructure used to coordinate any response. Today's machines are still mostly tools, not team mates. Our smart devices can be retrofitted to other machines to make them smarter and more resilient in a changing environment, independent from any infrastructure. Our Argonaut AI cameras watch for poachers in Africa, oil thieves in South America or potential suicides on the European railways. Our GENIE navigation units enable any drone to independently navigate and complete missions without GPS signals. We use the Cerebella mission management platform to gather best-in-class machines from an ever-increasing catalogue of partners and to integrate them into a human-centred workflow. Cerebella allows humans, AI, satellite analytics, robots, drones and IoT sensors to work together as part of a combined team in complex missions. These hybrid teams can respond faster and more effectively to safety or security threats over large remote areas. Whether it's cables being stolen, oil being tapped or elephants poached for ivory, we provide the ability for the security team to know before these incidents about to happen and immediately intervene or follow up.

Dr Douglas started Arete to apply his background in biomedical engineering to help improve care for people with chronic diseases. We've recieved about US$2m in competitive grant funding to build our prototype, alongside patients and clinicians to meet their needs. We envisage a world where preventable respiratory deaths are a thing of the past. A world where these conditions can be managed at home and not in the hospital. Our vision is to bring these measurements to everyone who needs them and where they need them with powerful data to manage their own health proactively. Asthma and COPD need a tool that is equivalent for what glucose monitoring is for T1 diabetes. Our solution \u2013 a patent and regulatory pending \u2013 digital health device has been developed to perform powerful daily monitoring at home. The Respicorder will bring specialist hospital grade measurements to be accessible when and where people with lung conditions are having symptoms. Ultimately, the product will form the key foundation for a digital hub to help people and their health care team manage lung conditons with precision and prevention. Globally over one billion people have a chronic respiratory disease that kills four million people every year. These deaths are preventable. Through better management and treatment people can live longer better lives. We aim to do this with a net savings to health care systems, as prevention is far cheaper than emergency care.",

      "description": "In today's world, where many of us are more comfortable communicating via WhatsApp and email than by speaking on the phone or face-to-face, the ability to deliver speech effectively is often neglected. gweek is a cutting-edge software that helps improve Speech intelligence through an advanced analytics and training platform, which provides immediate results and feedback in bite sized phases, to help people unlock their speech potential on the go. Unlike many corporate presentation tools which instruct people on \"how to\" present or speak in public, but often yield short term results, the gweek app - a \"personal communication coach\" - takes a more intuitive approach. Based on the belief that everyone is inherently Speech Intelligent, gweek helps harness the skills people already possess but don't necessarily know how to use, such as clarity and structure in speech. The software is comprised of learning levels, to help users achieve key milestones, or to simply provide help with rehearsing speech. gweek is a cognitive technology in that it knows what to listen and look for in order to help in a constructive, non-judgmental way. gweek uses audio and visual layers of machine learning to provide real-time analytics and bite-sized, micro-learning chunks. It empowers users to express themselves more effectively, and to tap into their most valuable currency \u2013 the way they present themselves. It empowers users to communicate 'with' not 'at' people. Through the use of smart Speech Intelligence Analytics, gweek has been able to consistently measure the components that make up clear, confident, yet authentic communication - to create a system which accurately scores users in real-time and helps them to improve their speaking capabilities. In both 2017 and 2018, gweek was recognised by CognitionX as a pioneer in its field by winning the AI Award for Innovation in Natural Language Processing.",

Since 2014 we have been helping our clients in the UK, Europe, North America and Australasia innovate and get to market faster, by providing them with robust and highly flexible solutions to program, simulate, control and monitor processes involving industrial machinery. As well as covering traditionally automated processes, we specialise in the programming of complex toolpaths, such as those required in additive manufacturing; highly variable jobs allowing production of small batches and unique items; and applications which require adapting robot tasks from various software ecosystems. Underpinning our services is the HAL Robotics Framework, an extensible and modular software which facilitates inter-device communication, adaptive programming of robot tasks, and motion planning for one or many robots working together. HAL Robotics have developed and tested the Framework in a variety of industries over the years, from aerospace to construction through food and beverage, ensuring that it can support any process asked of it. This flexibility, whilst an advantage in its own right, also acts as the basis for our bespoke software solutions for novel processes or markets. By tailoring solutions to clients' existing expertise, we lower the barrier to entry for robot use and provide interfaces in terms that they understand with links to software they already use. HAL Robotics stays at the forefront of innovation through internal and collaborative R&D projects. We also provide flexible application prototyping tools to researchers, whatever their field, allowing them to focus on the research that drives them. As well as accelerating and de-risking these experimental phases, using the same industry-ready tools in R&D endeavours guarantees that innovations are quick and easy to industrialise.",

Most of us have access to accounts and products through a personal credit history built over many years. Globally this isn't the case. Basic ID and credit history may not exist and be difficult to obtain, leaving 1.7 billion adults without access to financial services and a $5.2 trillion consumer financing gap. This shouldn't be happening. Technology has lowered barriers to entry and revolutionised other non-finance industries. Smartphone adoption grew 9% globally last year, providing a low-cost platform for consumers to access basic services from almost anywhere. Our app allows users to see all their financial data from one place, provides insights to better understand their finances and helps them build a credit profile to access products and services. We use APIs to connect users directly to their existing financial data for aggregation. AI analytics generate intelligent insights, which the user will use to access loans, credit, savings, insurance and investments. Our business model is B2B2C. We're not a bank and don't provide our own financial services but collaborate with Financial Institutions who provide products and services through our app. Our goal is to increase the supply of financial services to consumers and businesses, supporting sustainable economic growth and benefits for society.",

This industry is embarking on a major program of digital transformation which is driven by \"Industry 4.0\" initiatives and Hazid can play a significant role, in supporting enterprises through their journey. Hazid solutions can transform non-intelligent schematics and data sheets into \"\"intelligent\"\" data driven equivalents using AI. The unique approach reduces costs and execution times and increases quality based on minimising the amount of manual effort in the process. Schematics from all disciplines can be migrated including Piping (PFD's and P&ID's), Intrumentation, Electrical, Data Sheets etc. Data / schematics migration forms an integral part of rule based solutions to deliver corporate and standards based compliance through the application of Hazid's Engineering Integrity. Process Safety Integrity (PSI) enables users to build process safety models to simulate deviations from design intent. The topology of the plants P&IDs are used to run simulations and determine many of the plants cause-consequence scenarios and utilize these as a first pass for the Hazop team to build on through brainstorming. High quality, intelligent P&ID's and data are a pre-requisite as a starting point, therefore we strongly recommend the use of our Engineering Integrity solution to validate the P&ID's and data to ensure useable results. The simulations and results are determined by the knowledge base that is contained within the system and is adapted to reflect the individual requirements and experiences of each company. Hazid Technologies work closely and in collaboration with you to establish your specific knowledge base. The different scenarios can be interactively displayed on the P&IDs and other information can be added such as likelihood, severity, risk, safeguards, actions etc. then SIL / LOPA analysis.\"",

Over a minimum of a 5-year period, Fusionex will be deploying Big Data Analytics to increase the efficiency of its client's interaction with existing customers, as well as provide solutions to utilize available data in order to craft better offerings that would empower the client to capture newer markets. In order to gain a better outlook of the performance and health of the client's sales activities, a cost utilization analytics module will be provided by Fusionex. This will help the client inform its corporate customers about the performance of their corporate accounts \u2013 e.g. details such as how much cost has been utilized by staff, how much was claimed for spouses or dependents, and even illnesses involved and medical facilities visited. This will help corporate customers determine if their account is being fully or partially utilized, and whether or not coverage should be increased for their staff. The cost utilization analytics module can also be used by the client's team to generate new products that they can upsell and cross-sell to existing customers. Fusionex and the client will also be working closely together to formulate strategies to penetrate the insurance market through social media analytics and digital marketing. Capturing the right data in a timely manner is important for decision makers in the client's organization, to determine long term strategies as well as day to day actions. To achieve this, Fusionex GIANT 2017 (targeted for official release imminently) will not only accumulate and cleanse disparate datasets, but also be used to find historical patterns and predict future trends in data (structured, semi-structured and unstructured). Via GIANT, the client will be able to determine claim patterns of its customers and will be able to craft products that better cater to these customers, focusing on their specific needs. The client will also be able to cross sell products if they identify, for example, the trend of city dwellers \u2013 e.g. allowing for targeted auto insurance products and sales. By putting business and customer data to effective use, the client is able to transform seemingly dormant information into game-changing insights that can help them satisfy their customers, improve their offerings, and boost their bottom-line. Ivan Teh, Fusionex Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"We are delighted to enter into this long-term partnership with such a valued client, which is in line with our mission of using technology to enable businesses to be more agile, and with greater impact. Fusionex is committed towards helping the client gain an optimum leverage in its field.",

Broilers are chickens raised for meat; and we'll rear up to 1.8 trillion in the next few decades. While bird welfare is at the heart of what we do, our tech also enables increased productivity and profitability for farmers (know in the industry as 'performance'), more transparency and accountability across the full supply chain (including for you \u2013 the consumer), and reduced environmental impact. A classic win-win-win-win, as they say. Here's how the FLOX Fix works: Off-the-shelf hardware (cameras & sensors) + advanced AI (machine vision and learning) + 24/7 alerts and analytics = better welfare and performance. Since founding in 2018, we've grown to a team of 14 across offices in London, the SW of England, and Poland. Our core product is operational in 10 commercial sheds, and we count the UK's largest poultry producer as a client. FLOX is backed by some of the best in the business \u2013 funded by SpeedInvest (EU), Acequia Capital (US), & AI Seed Fund (UK) & the European Space Agency. Our founding team has built, scaled and sold 8 poultry and AI companies between them. In short, we're ready to take our tech to sheds everywhere and get on with doing the important work of improving the lives of the chickens we eat. Demand for poultry isn't going anywhere \u2013 and neither are we! We're also recruiting fresh farmers for our EarlyBird programme \u2013 so get in touch if you'd like to be an early adopter of FLOX!",

      "description": "We make healthcare maximally intelligent by offering expert information for patients' professional care and self-care, based on their diseases, genotypes, medicines and lifestyles. To do which, we provide integrated and interoperable information to whom, when and how it is needed \u2013 to clinicians, of course, and to the patient especially. By these means, we liberate them from disconnected silos that inevitably lead to less-than-integrated care. With advanced analytics and artificial intelligence, clinicians can show, for example, how multiple combinations of genomic attributes, prescribed drugs and test results lead to actual clinical outcomes. Using these analyses, clinical researchers can benchmark pathways and infer new best-practice, to embed improvement at great scale. Our \"Future Perfect\" for Healthcare: making health and care maximally intelligent will be achieved by: Creating the evidence base needed to inform how to care (or self-care), making it relevant, extensive, constantly expanded and updated Collecting the data from across prescribing, diagnostic, genomic, robotic and digital sources Liberating and democratising the data, breaking down silos, making it ready for us to develop and deploying new applications for advanced analyses Deploying AI tools to analyse such massive data - for example, to show the actual clinical outcomes people experience linked to their genomic attributes, diagnostic and interventive procedures and prescribed drugs Using these analyses to benchmark and infer new best-practice Closing the loop and re-do the cycle, embedding improvement at great scale. We are engaged to advise several genome programmes and e-Prescribing implementations.

      "description": "Our vision is to incorporate Generic AI into every system that can benefit from generic artificial intelligence capability. The system was initially developed in 1983 as a music composition tool, where the composer manipulates the paths of counterpoint melodies. The development of the system was inspired by Leonard Bernstein's Harvard Lectures on music theory based on Chomskyan linguistics - titled The Unanswered Question. Chomsky said: 'He (Bernstein) was onto something, but I couldn't really judge how significant it was...'. Bernstein's analysis of Mozart's 40th in G Minor showed characteristics corresponding to the physical Principle of Least Action and symmetry over scale analogous to gauge invariance in field theory. This analysis formed the starting point from which Generic AI was ultimately developed. By 1989 the core theoretical problem was solved; this took the form of a general-purpose artificial intelligence system. However, it was apparent that it would be at least 20 years before it could be implemented, due to the rate of improvement in computing power. By 2002 parallel processing was close enough to start developing commercial applications taking into account the development time, and so the company: Generic AI Ltd was incorporated. Our objective is to demonstrate the 'Artificial General Intelligence' (AGI) properties of the system by creating as many varied applications as possible. Generic AI has these properties: The core Generic AI system always works in the same way for every application It has no pre-programmed rules The data it processes is in a universal format Customised interfaces convert data into this core universal format Patterns and features exist in a kind of 'common currency' between all possible kinds of data input. This enables meaningful data-fusion between disparate data sources.",

      "description": "The main Programming focus is on Spark (Scala, SQL and R). We will also use an ioT platform (like Thingworx) The participants need to be able to Code/come from a development background (the Programming language itself does not matter). The course is based on modelling IoT based problems in the R programming language. We follow a context based learning approach \u2013 hence we co-relate the maths to specific R based IoT models. You will need an aptitude for maths. However, we cover the mathematical foundations necessary. These include: Linear Algebra including Matrix algebra, Bayesian Statistics, Optimization techniques (such as Gradient descent) etc. In 2015, IoT is emerging but the impact is yet to be felt over the next five years. Today, we see IoT driven by Bluetooth 4.0 including iBeacons. Over the next five years, we will see IoT connectivity driven by the wide area network (with the deployment of 5G 2020 and beyond). We will also see entirely new forms of connectivity (ex from companies like Sigfox). Enterprises (Renewables, Telematics, Transport, Manufacturing, Energy, Utilities etc) will be the key drivers for IoT. On the consumer side, Retail and wearables will play a part. This tsunami of data will lead to an exponential demand for analytics since analytics is the key business model behind the data deluge. Most of this data will be Time series data but will also include other types of data. For example, our emphasis on IoT also includes Deep Learning since we treat video and images as sensors. IoT will lead to a Re-imagining of everyday objects. The course emphasizes some aspects are unique to IoT (in comparison to traditional data science). These include: A greater emphasis on time series data, Edge computing, Real-time processing, Cognitive computing, In memory processing, Deep learning, Geospatial analysis for IoT, Managing massive geographic scale(ex for Smart cities), Telecoms datasets, Strategies for integration with hardware and Sensor fusion (Complex event processing).",

We are building a dashboard allowing risk/asset managers and their analysts to obtain the right information edge at the right time. We do so by dynamically processing news, press releases, company filings, investment research or earnings transcripts, and leveraging advanced AI and mathematical methods, some as recent as Fall 2020, including among others non-trivial usage of transformers and topological data analysis. We are motivated by mitigating the risks of another financial crisis due to a lack of timely access to the right economic insights. Indeed, the sanity of the global financial system relies on investors and insurers correctly measuring the inherent risks to their positions, and failure to adequately process the relevant data in time may result in credit defaults or under-performance: an overall lost value for the economy. What adds to the issue is that the amount of unstructured textual data available to the actors of the Finance & Insurance industry has lately grown to an overwhelming degree.

      "description": "John, Fiona and Mark first met at a med-tech startup in 2014. The company had developed core machine vision technology for surgical procedures. The technical challenge that John faced was that the core technology required massive computing power. Fiona was clear that using the company's limited funds to buy servers was completely out of the question. John quickly realised that the only solution was to switch the processing into the cloud. Harnessing first 36 and then 64 high-performance GPGPU petaflop cloud computers enabled John to reduce the processing time from 20 minutes to <5 seconds. The fact that the servers were on-demand also made for huge cost-efficiencies and scalability at minimum investment. But this meant that patient data not only had to leave the hospital, it had to go out into the cloud and back again. John's next challenge was to design and implement a security architecture would connect live imaging, archived imaging (PACS) and user interactions to the cloud in a way that would conform to the differing patient data security requirements of hospitals across the globe. As part of this process, John and Fiona built a new Information Security Management System (ISMS) from scratch for ISO 27001 certification and HIPPA compliance. Fiona also had to arrange cyber insurance for the business which proved both costly and complex. While we maintained an entirely separate network and highly secure network for the patient data as we set up and operated the ISMS, we quickly recognised cyber risk exposures on the corporate network. In particular, each time we conducted an internal audit, we realised that we did not always have full and immediate visibility to all the devices installed on our own network, let alone what applications, particularly cloud applications, had been installed on those devices and what data was being held on those devices. Every audit involved a significant investment in human time and resource. What we needed, we realised, was a simple cost-effective tool that would automatically detect and report on actual cyber risks on the corporate network, track remediations and monitor changes in the risk profile. We could not find it. In November 2017, we set up InsurTechnix, with the express purpose of using our experience of SME cyber security and cyber insurance to develop a simple, cost-effective cyber risk management solution for non-technical users.",

People's free time is valuable and current recommendation products are not great. But itcher discovers 'hidden gems' differently to any other product out there. We link like-minded people, segmenting them by their reviews across four entertainment verticals and enabling them to communicate and discover through one another. We have been quoted in media to be \"The Trip Advisor for Entertainment.\" We were also chosen by Google Home as launch partner within their entertainment \"skills\". This is consistent with our grand vision. We aim to power recommendations across all categories in the future. We will soon (August 2018) be deploying \"Couple Recommendations\" in an effort to reduce friction between spouses on Friday and Saturday evenings. itcher users will be able to link their profiles to one another to get movie and tv show recommendations that they'll both enjoy. We see this as a game changer, and unique to the industry. Initially a pure B2C business, we have expanded into B2B serving now as a back-end engine powering discovery of streaming content within/across delivery platforms. itcher also has an online magazine ( itcher.com/mag ), covering curated entertainment recommendations for movies, TV shows books, music and games.

By providing an end-to-end solution we are able to offer a streamlined route for water utilities to innovate whilst rapidly realising the benefits; without needing to piece together the solution themselves. Historically sensors have only measured a few parameters, our Intellisondes accurately measure up to 8 parameters at once. By measuring these parameters, we have managed to use our devices to identify the root cause of discolouration issues, water source mixing, leakage, chemical dosing issues and reservoir ingress, many of which are not possible without the combination of parameters provided by the Intellisonde. Often communications can be overlooked, but providing reliable access to data is key to being able to use that data for decision making. As a result, we created the Intellihub, our communications module, which is able to provide high data availability underground in remote locations, regularly achieving above 95% data availability in some of the most challenging environments. In order to interpret the data and make it useful for decision making, we created our intelligence systems which use bespoke AI algorithms to extract meaningful insights from the data. Our systems can work with 3rd party data or our own sensors, enabling the utilities to get greater value out of their existing assets. The data is visualised through our Insight web-app, this provides intuitive ways to see exactly which parts of the water network need addressing as well as offering tools to enable drilling-down into the root of the problem. Our system automatically processes the data ready for visualisation meaning information on water source mixing, root cause analysis for discolouration, leakage or reservoir ingress are all available instantly through our Insight web-app.",

Using our robots, we can provide accurate, high-resolution 3D models and other visualizations to determine the condition of an infrastructure nearly in real-time. This innovative approach is beneficial to carry out inspections of underground, closed or confined areas. This is particularly the case under harsh, dark and dangerous conditions where the inspection process based on current methods entails a major health risk for human operators. Besides the gain in safety our approach boosts the overall efficiency of the process as well as the accuracy of the obtained results. The solution was successfully tested on a global scale in real environments such as underground mines, penstocks in hydroelectric dams, nuclear waste detection and tunnel construction. Further industries have shown significant interest in the technology to carry out inspections. We consider ourselves as a data service company, where the inhouse-developed robot is used as the main tool to gather the data. One of our principles is to keep the highest possible manufacturing range in-house ensuring the control of the supply chain, the delivered quality to the customer as well as the corresponding lead-time.",

Our Series A investors Andreessen Horowitz and Horizons Ventures are both joining this round with follow-on investments, and we are very grateful to all our investors for their support. Andreessen Horowitz led our first series A investment. Horizons Ventures, who led a further Series A round, also invested in us at the seed stage and have been with us through every round. The advice and support of experienced investors such as Solina Chau, Chris Dixon and Marc Andreessen, along with many others, has been invaluable. We are now excited to add the support of Masayoshi Son and SoftBank to realising our vision of massive scale virtual worlds and the transformative impact they can have on how we live our lives. I am delighted to say that none of our investors or founders will be selling any of their stakes as part of this round \u2013 we intend to fully dedicate this investment to building our business and technology. We are excited to also announce that Deep Nishar from SoftBank will join the board at Improbable. At Improbable we are working towards a future in which participatory virtual worlds and simulations of unimaginable scale become ubiquitous. We think this is potentially as exciting and important a technical development as work on AI or the Internet of Things. We think that the games of today are an incredibly exciting medium, but also that they will evolve into massive worlds and offer meaningful experiences for a much broader segment of society than previously imagined. It's our goal to solve the critical technical problems and unlock that future. Now we have the resources to fully realise that vision over the long term with our growing ecosystem of partners. This investment further cements our long term commitment to working with the games industry to create the experiences of tomorrow. Over the longer term, we are also excited by the potential of our technology to inform the understanding of real world systems and their emergent complexity. We are already working on projects with telecommunications companies, governments and other enterprise clients to explore the ability of massive, detailed simulations to drive better decisions using real-world data and hope to talk more about this in the future. To achieve both these ambitious goals, we need to take bold steps. This investment gives us the ability to take those steps. If you are interested by the possibilities, and would like to know more, the easiest way to experience our technology in beta is to download our SDK from spatialos.improbable.io, see how easy it is to build game worlds using standard tools and engines and to join our growing developer community. We have a long way to go, but this will accelerate our journey enormously, and we are looking forward to sharing more on our technology roadmap and our plans shortly.",

      "description": "Podcasts have seen in the recent years a steady increase in numbers, both in terms of listeners and content providers. Apple reported in 2018 over 550,000 active podcast channels, with over 18.5 million episodes in over 100 languages worldwide. With so many resources available, finding the podcast episodes to listen to is one of the main issues that listeners face. The problem is that podcasts are generally organised in lists and catalogues for listeners to subscribe to, or they are sorted based on popularity. In MIXTAPE we aim to improve the way podcasts are searched by allowing listeners to find content based on topics of interest. For the first time it will be possible to find individual podcast episodes based on your preferences and precise interests. To enable this we will be using speech processing and natural language understanding adding these key components to our existing content management platform.",

      "description": "Flock was founded on the conviction that insurance was no longer fit for purpose in our fast-moving, hyper-connected world. So we set out to bridge the gap between the insurance industry of today and the emerging technologies of tomorrow. We began in the commercial drone industry, using real-time data (like population density and wind speed) to quantify, insure, and mitigate drone flight risks. We insured thousands of innovative drone operations globally, from agricultural surveyors to NHS medical delivery flights. Our technology helped thousands of pilots around the world to fly safer, reducing their risk exposure by 15% on average. We recently expanded into the rapidly evolving world of connected motor fleets. Modern fleets change on a daily basis; expanding, contracting, and adopting the latest technology. They need an insurance policy that's as agile and data-driven as they are; so we launched Flock Motor, our connected vehicle division offering insurance designed for the 21st-century fleet. But we're not done yet. The world is becoming increasingly connected and autonomous, bringing both amazing opportunities and complex risks. As the insurer of the future, Flock will not only pay claims when incidents occur; we'll help our customers understand and mitigate their own risks, to avoid things going wrong in the first place. We are making the world a safer, smarter place.",

Founded in 2015 out of Maxwell Harding's frustration with lunchtime queues, Dynamify's digital ordering technology is now deployed in North America, the U.K., Continental Europe and Asia. Contract catering clients include Sodexo, Elior, Atalian, CH&CO, BaxterStorey, Gather & Gather, Bartlett Mitchell, Lexington, Vacherin, The Good Eating Company and cloud canteens Nourish, Fooditude, Foodee and Alchemista. Dynamify's modular technology contains all the features required by caterers within one app: ranging from preordering and self-checkout to delivery. Dynamify's proprietary algorithm tells operators how long it will take them to prepare an order based on the time of the day and the type of order, then intelligently matches demand and supply to predict accurate order collection times and reduce crowding. Dynamify's analytics dashboard provides powerful insights, including predictions of each customer's lifetime value and food consumption patterns using machine learning, which can be leveraged for personalised marketing and inventory management. Dynamify's contact-free technology has become essential for caterers to resume operations during coronavirus. Dynamify can launch a best-in-class app, which enables caterers to safely and conveniently provide food to their customers at the office and at home, within 24 hours. No external visitors are required on site to deploy Dynamify's plug-and-play cloud technology \u2013 and a new restaurant can go-live with digital ordering in under 2.5 minutes.",

      "description": "\"DataSwarm Predictive Analytics tracks what we call the \"\"Zeitgeist\"\" for any particular topic, and is useful for many applications. It highlights changes over time, relationships between subjects, and works as an early warning system for emerging trends, good and bad. We initially developed the system for a BBC News requirement to \"\"find the Zeitgeist\"\" in news story development. DataSwarm predictive analytics has since also been succesfully used for a number of other applications: - Election Prediction (we predicted Brexit and Trump, against the run of other predictions) - Changes in company fundamentals and competitive positioning - Marketing Insights, especially across multiple global markets - Price prediction of various asset classes and indices We won an Award in the 2019 IARPA (US Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) Geoforecasting Challenge 2 where we had to predict a wide variety of geopolitical events in a competitive environment against other systems. We are thus confident that the system is effectiove, and also has a lot more useful applications than it has been used for to date. We are also continuously adding new matehmatical techniques to increase its capabilities, including Machine Learning and AI* We have also developed the DataSwarm Trading System, to allow investors to blend DataSwarm analysis of stock market behaviour, stock analysis and industry trends with more traditional market data. We have been succesfully trading in the US markets using the system since December 2019 with 56% return to date (Nov 2021) when we stopped rading temporarily to test and implement our new fully automated end to end trading system. *The term \"\"AI\"\" is abused these days. We are using AI techniques to solve certain bounded issues, not \"\"General\"\" AI\"",

The two firms will collaborate to build data-driven business products. These will draw on McLaren's engineering, sensor, simulation and analytics experience first developed and proven in the ultra-competitive world of motorsport, coupled with Deloitte's digital and analytics experience delivering large consulting projects globally. The joint partnership will aim to create products that can provide more than \u00a31bn in annual benefits for clients by 2022, including savings, growth, productivity and quality improvements. Looking to address complex, industry-wide challenges and improve performance across clients' businesses \u2013 initially focussed in healthcare, life sciences, retail and transport \u2013 the products will combine specialist hardware and software, with sophisticated algorithms. These will aim to bridge the \"physical-to-digital\" divide by helping organisations make sense of data. This can include capturing data from physical sensors to create a sophisticated digital record; enriching it using advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning; and delivering information in automated and more effective ways. As part of the partnership, the two firms will aim to hire around 150 new highly-skilled employees. The majority of these will be based in joint headquarters in central London, expected to open in early 2018. While the partnership will be headquartered and initially launched in the UK, the products created will be rolled out across clients and markets in Deloitte's global network of member firms over the next two years. This will include target markets in North America, Europe and Asia. Mike Dobby, vice chairman and senior consulting partner at Deloitte, said: \"This partnership with McLaren Applied Technologies opens up a number of opportunities for Deloitte, particularly for our consulting business. Increasingly clients are turning to us not only for advice, but also for digital and physical products to solve their problems. McLaren has a proven record of successfully applying their technologies to real-world business situations across a range of sectors. Ian Rhodes, Chief Executive Officer, McLaren Applied Technologies, said: \"McLaren is first and foremost a technology company and among the pioneers of collecting data through sensors and then interpreting and using that in clever ways to generate insight. We realise the huge potential for us to take that kind of experience to improve businesses and solve some of their most pressing challenges. So it makes sense for us to partner with a company like Deloitte who have a range of complementary digital and analytics skills, combined with a global network of clients and locations, to scale our co-created data driven business products.",

Download the full white paper here. The authors believe that AI could become the most transformative workplace technology of the 21st century, with the associated need for business leaders to assure themselves that they are deploying AI effectively and responsibly. Superhuman Resources sets out a series of practical questions for businesses to address in respect of AI in the areas of governance and quality assurance, in addition to tackling crucial legal considerations. These include privacy and data processing legislation compliance, the potential for discriminatory outputs from AI systems, and the fair allocation of risk. This guidance is set against a regulatory backdrop that poses distinct challenges for policymakers and corporate governance. While the growth of AI is no different from that of other fields of innovation in respect of the need to develop ethics and laws simultaneously, it offers a real opportunity for businesses to shape and influence legal and regulatory frameworks as they begin to adapt to machine-based processes, products and services",

      "description": "Enterprises worldwide spend over $40Bn annually on manually extracting data from documents. This extraordinary sum represents hundreds of millions of human hours spent on tedious, grinding, soul-crushing work which is also slow and prone to errors. The incumbent technology, OCR (optical character recognition) has been around for decades. It's simplistic, rule-based and performs poorly on many real-life documents. We founded Evolution AI in 2015 to solve that problem. Evolution AI revolutionised data extraction by building a deep-learning machine that closely mimics how humans read documents. Humans not only read characters off the page, we heavily rely on visual cues from graphic design (tables, font types and sizes, colours, bold/italic etc) and of course - on meaning and context. In AI terms, these translate to Visual Reasoning - a branch of computer vision that focuses on how objects visually relate to each other - and NLP (Natural Language Processing), dealing with meaning and semantics. In short, our AI weaves together text, vision and semantics to extract data from documents - just like humans do. Today we process over 1.5M pages per day for our clients. Our unique scientific approach enables us to automatically extract data from any type of document including the most complicated such as quarterly reports, balance sheets, P&L statements, account statements, invoices etc.",

Traditional searching is done with keywords, in combination or proximity; semantic searching is done by expanding to related concepts, which are largely found in similar contexts. In contrast, the key concept behind our technology is very simple. We read the full content of the search document and compare the terms we find with the content of all of the other documents in the dataset. This approach is at the heart of our long-established plagiarism detection programs. The technology can be used for the identification of relevant information in any large document dataset.

Datasets often matter more than algorithms per se, though they rarely get proper credit for the value that they can create.Datasets such as Fei-Fei Li's ImageNet have enabled the recent expansion in capability of machine intelligence in powerful new ways that otherwise would be impossible.We want to do the same for the space of kind behaviours \u2013 a massive collaboration efforts to construct, collate, and annotate a range of datasets that reflect many different cultures, opinions and creeds, and which can expand in scope and nuance over time, to empower socially-aware thinking machines for generations to come. We have a vision of building a safer and more just world, by enabling humans and machines to make better decisions, and creating trust through verifiable behavioural rulesets. We recognise that ethics are varied across time, geography, and culture. We intend to democratize access and opportunity for contribution to this world-changing system, that is currently concentrated in the hand of a few AI researchers/engineers. Our goal is to advance the field of machine ethics, by seeding a framework for analysis of various ethical situations, in a way that can be easily understood by both humans and machines. Through our dataset we seek to support new ways of expressing ethics computationally, building on the latest and best available research. Creating a computable framework of ethics is an extremely challenging and daring endeavour, but an essential enabling technology for global civilization. Our Massive Transformational Purpose: Help Machines Make Decisions That Enable Flourishing.

St Thomas' Hospital, which is now a teaching hospital of King's College London School of Medicine, has roots dating back to 1173. In 1836, King's became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London. King's is based in the centre of London and organised into nine academic schools, spread across four Thames-side campuses in central London and another in Denmark Hill in south London. It is one of the largest centres for graduate and post-graduate medical teaching and biomedical research in Europe; it is home to six Medical Research Council centres for <a href=''https://www.dissertationcorp.co.uk/''>dissertation help</a> , the most of any British university, and is a founding member of the King's Health Partners academic health sciences centre. King's has around 25,000 students and 6,113 staff and had a total income of \u00a3587 million in 2012/13, of which \u00a3164 million was from research grants and contracts.

The university offers degree courses in a variety of disciplines. Study is available at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, full-time and part-time, and research opportunities are offered. Cardiff Metropolitan University has a number of research and enterprise centres, including the Food Industry Centre, the Welsh Centre for Tourism Research, and the National Centre for Product Design and Development Research.  Under its previous name (the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff, or UWIC), the university had its degrees awarded by the University of Wales. However, UWIC formally ended its association with the University of Wales, and was renamed Cardiff Metropolitan University in November 2011.[4] The university will also now award all of its degrees in its own name.  Despite this 'withdrawal' from the University of Wales, the new Cardiff Metropolitan University retains close formal links with it. Until summer 2012 they shared the same Pro Vice Chancellor of Research, Professor Robert Brown. Cardiff Metropolitan University briefly continued to supply its staff for the University of Wales to use as moderators for their overseas franchised degrees.

In many ways the Colleges are considered universities in their own right; they set their own entrance criteria for their courses and they offer their own services to students. Some now also have their own degree awarding powers. All students from all the Colleges and Institutes are also University of London students, making them part of a community of over 120,000 students and giving them access to many services in London.  Did you know that when making your application through UCAS you can apply to up to five University of London Colleges? They are all considered separate institutions when it comes to applying. Postgraduate students apply directly to the College or Colleges they wish to study with.  Many levels of study are covered at the University of London including foundation, undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, as well as diplomas and research degrees. The Colleges also have a wide range of short courses and summer programmes. Pre-university school students are also able to sample University of London courses and life through the Taster Course programme.  It is not even essential to be in London to study for a University of London degree. We currently have over 54,000 students studying in 180 different countries with the University of London International Programmes.

      "description": "The University of St Andrews (Scots: University o St Andras; abbreviated as St And, from the Latin Sancti Andreae, in post-nominals) is a British public university in St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. It is the oldest of the four ancient universities of Scotland and the third oldest university in the English-speaking world (following Oxford and Cambridge Universities). St Andrews was founded between 1410 and 1413, when the Avignon Antipope Benedict XIII issued a papal bull to a small founding group of Augustinian clergy. St Andrews is made up of a variety of institutions, comprising three colleges \u2013 United College (a union of St Salvator's and St Leonard's Colleges), St Mary's College, and St Leonard's College, the last named being a non-statutory revival of St Leonard's as a post-graduate society. There are 18 academic schools organised into four faculties.[5] The university occupies historic and modern buildings located throughout the town. The academic year is divided into two terms, Martinmas and Candlemas. In term time, over one-third of the town's population is either a staff member or student of the university.[6] The student body is notably diverse: over 145 nationalities are represented with 45% of its intake from countries outside the UK; about one-eighth of the students are from the rest of the EU and the remaining third are from overseas \u2014 15% from North America alone.[7][8] The university's sport teams compete in BUCS competitions,[9] and the student body is known for preserving ancient traditions such as Raisin Weekend, May Dip, and the wearing of distinctive academic dress.[10] It is ranked as the third best university in the United Kingdom in two of three national league tables, behind Oxbridge.[11][12][13] The Guardian ranks first in the United Kingdom the Schools of Physics and Astronomy, International Relations, Computer Science, Geography, English and Mathematics,[12] whilst The Times and Sunday Times ranks the Schools of English, Management, Philosophy, Anatomy and Physiology and Middle Eastern and African Studies first[14] and the Complete University Guide ranks Management, Divinity and Middle Eastern and African Studies first.[15] The Times Higher Education World Universities Ranking names St Andrews among the world's Top 50 universities for Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities.[16][17] St Andrews consistently holds the highest student satisfaction scores amongst all multi-faculty universities in the United Kingdom.[18] St Andrews has many notable alumni and affiliated faculty, including eminent mathematicians, scientists, theologians, philosophers, and politicians. Recent alumni include the former First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond; former Secretary of State for Defence Michael Fallon; HM British Ambassador to China Barbara Woodward; United States Ambassador to Hungary Colleen Bell; Olympic cycling gold medalist Chris Hoy; and royals Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Six Nobel Laureates are among St Andrews' alumni and former staff: two in Chemistry and Physiology or Medicine, and one each in Peace and Literature.",

They combine industry expertise with innovative technology to deliver critical information to leading decision makers in the financial, legal, tax & accounting, scientific, healthcare and media markets, powered by the world's most trusted news organization. RVC, the former venture capital arm of Reuters, was set up in 1994 and began investing RVC I (originally known as The Greenhouse Fund) in Palo Alto, California in 1995. In 1997, RVC expanded the focus of its operations to Europe, bringing its significant Silicon Valley experience to a market with relatively few venture capitalists focused on early stage information technology companies. In September 2001, RVC became independent from Reuters and is now wholly owned by its Investment Partners and Chairman. It was awarded the contract to continue managing RVC I on behalf of Reuters. In establishing its investment independence, RVC has retained its strong relationships with Reuters, its affiliates (Tibco, Factiva, Instinet, Radianz) and its customers, which are primarily financial services and media companies who were amongst the first to be impacted by and adopt new technology. Building on RVC's relationship with Reuters in financial services, RVC is developing similar relationships with leading corporations in other verticals, and acquiring deeper understanding of the needs and challenges CIOs and business decision makers have in increasing efficiency and/or revenues through their leverage of IT investments. In early 2004, after 10 years of successful technology investments, Reuters announced a strategy of refocusing on its core activities and away from venture technology investments. Over the ensuing few months, the partners at RVC explored the opportunity of buying RGF and successfully obtained debt financing for the purchase. On 22 June 2004, Norman Fiore, Martin Stapleton and John Taysom along with Chairman Sir David Walker became the new owners of RGF via their new vehicle Sofius Capital. RVC will remain the manager of the RGF and will continue to invest in RGF portfolio companies to maximise the overall return on the committed capital of the fund. Since inception, RVC I has invested \u20ac449 million in 82 companies, including Yahoo!, Verisign, Phone.com (now Openwave Systems), Digimarc, Infoseek, Orchestream, and Metamerge, amongst others. With 16 IPOs and 27 trade sales or other cash realisations, and a first fund that is 94% returned, they believe they have one of the strongest track records in Europe. Today, RVC has 11 staff located in London and the Silicon Valley.",

They also like to invest once a company has launched their product and has some clients they can reference. Revenues are usually from zero to \u00a350k per month when they first invest. They like to play an active role in helping the companies that they invest in, at least until their companies have secured one or more later financing rounds. They want to help entrepreneurs turn their early stage ventures into fast growing companies built to grow into significant and valuable entities.  They see every investment as a partnership. Indeed, they share their office with a number of portfolio companies so they work very closely with them.",

If your business requires consumer adoption, it's not for us. We back companies that sell products and services to other companies. * Deep technology.

We know that great innovation can come from anywhere. Our focus is on companies born on the ''right'' side of the Atlantic, specifically in Europe or Israel. * Global ambition. While it's possible to build a great business without targeting a global opportunity, we are exclusively focused on companies that are chasing a truly global opportunity. In most cases, this means a focus on US market entry from day one. * Outstanding founding teams with domain expertise.

The EBRD is the largest single investor in the region and mobilises significant foreign direct investment beyond its own financing. It is owned by 61 countries and two intergovernmental institutions. But despite its public sector shareholders, it invests mainly in private enterprises, usually together with commercial partners.  It provides project financing for banks, industries and businesses, both new ventures and investments in existing companies.

Reading an article about the original Silicon Valley Internet Incubator, Y-Combinator, in 2011 convinced him that this was the safest route for investing. He then found that existing UK based incubators were mainly in London and required investment through a funding vehicle, not directly into the startups themselves, making it difficult for investors to benefit from the all important SEIS tax relief. With the establishment of the Engine Shed, Mike saw that Bristol now had the perfect venue for an internet incubator and after assembling a team of top Bristol based mentors and business advisors, Webstart Bristol was born.",
