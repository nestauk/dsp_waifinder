Visit us at Deeep\u2122 - https://www.deeep.digital/ - London\u2019s First AI Art Fair from 13th - 17th October 2021. Gallery: www.oxia-palus.com Contact: enquiries@oxia-palus.com Our work combines the technologies of spectroscopic imaging, artificial intelligence, and 3D printing to recreate lost artwork. Our vision is to bring to life an artist parallel universe. With potentially thousands of works of art hidden dormant beneath existing paintings the journey in resurrecting the world\u2019s lost art has only just begun. In September 2019 Oxia Palus featured in MIT Technology Review for reconstructing La Femme Perdue and subsequently gained worldwide press coverage. Since then Oxia Palus has presented research at NeurIPS 2019, came 3rd in NVIDIA\u2019s Top 10 AI Developer Stories of 2019 and recently featured in NVIDIA\u2019s GTC 2020 Keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. In May 2020 Oxia Palus joined NVIDIA\u2019s Inception Program. In October 2020 we featured in NVIDIA\u2019s GTC Inaugural AI Art Gallery to unveil Madonna, a lost Leonardo da Vinci, hidden beneath da Vinci\u2019s Virgin of the Rocks. In December 2020 we partnered with MORF Gallery, a futuristic online gallery showcasing limited edition fine art. In 2021 Oxia Palus joined Conception X. In April 2021, Oxia Palus and MORF Gallery unveiled and sold The World's First NeoMaster\u2122 - Parc del Laberint d'Horta - a lost masterpiece resurrected on canvas using spectroscopy, artificial intelligence and 3D printing paired with an NFT. In June 2021 Oxia Palus won CogX's Best Innovation in Creative Arts 2021 and showcased World\u2019s First NeoMaster\u2122 Exhibition at the Lebenson Gallery in London. We plan to showcase new work at London's first AI dedicated art fair, Deeep\u2122, from 13 - 17th October 2021. Founded in London in January 2019 by George Cann and Anthony Bourached.",

      "description": "Precision (aka personalised) medicine is an emerging approach that takes into account individual variation to predict which treatment/prevention strategies will work in which groups of people. For example, colon cancers that have a normally functioning version of a surface protein called KRAS are likely to respond to certain anti-EGFR antibody therapies; those in which the protein is absent or non-fun. Successful innovation in precision medicine requires several sectors (academia, healthcare and industry) work together - often easier said than done. P4 sits at the intersection of these sectors, leveraging our academic, industry and healthcare connections to create a healthtech ecosystem to supercharge the development and scale of precision medicine technologies. Our flagship \u201caccelerator\u201d programme is the first of its kind in the UK, and is a partnership with UCL and Barclays.

      "description": "AI & Automation Personalisation SAAS Technology. Here at Personify XP, we have a passion for making everyone's digital experiences personal. Josh and Ben started Personify XP because we recognized that 95% of people who visit a website are anonymous and receive a generic experience. That's just not good enough. That's not because companies haven't recognised how important these visitors are - it's just that there has been no great way to do it. For so long companies have focused on \u2018knowing the customer' before they can personalise to them. With GDPR and people becoming much more cautious over sharing data it has become harder to personalise to website visitors as companies know less about their visitors. Even when there is a lot of data available on customers it still takes considerable time within a company to segment their visitors and then manually create the user journeys for each of these segments. Personalisation takes a lot of time and a lot of decisioning - why couldn't all of this be automated? The Personify Anonymous Experience platform is the first platform to focus exclusively on anonymous visitors. Our AI platform connects great products with shoppers you know nothing about through automating how content and products are shown to which shoppers and when. We provide unique insight into how your anonymous customers shop whilst ensuring your customers data is private and we are GDPR complaint out-of-the-box. We drive 15% additional revenue and 35% higher conversions through our patent pending AI technology. We are delighted to partner with brands such as Hawes & Curtis, Finery London, Ghost and Interhatch to provide incredibly personalised experiences to their anonymous visitors.",

      "description": "Creating intelligent automation for wind turbine inspections and more. Utilizing an intelligent Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV), Perceptual Robotics provides existing inspection engineers with a new, cost effective inspection tool that increases number of inspections, and quality, whilst minimising health and safety risks. Dhalion is an autonomous inspection platform for wind turbines. At the press of a button Dhalion allows existing O&M teams to complete wind turbine inspections in minutes rather hours with increased inspection quality. The path is optimised for optimum coverage, reliability in weather and consistent data acquisiton. Throughout the flight Dhalion minds its surrounding and deals intelligently with obstacles and unexpected situations. The inspection data are then automatically distilled to useful information about position, size and severity of defects on the tower and blades. It can identify lightning strikes, cracks, erosion and delamination as well as highlight anything out of the ordinary. The consistent data capture allows for long term analytics from data mining massive amounts of information to inform O&M decision making.",

Body Focused Repetitive Behaviours (BFRBs) that affect up to 1 in 20 of the population, and still carry a lot of stigma, with a lack of resources and support. Nudge is proudly raising awareness of BFRBs, conditions that can be debilitating for many. Nudge uses artificial intelligence, including gesture recognition technology and neural network programming to detect when you move your hand towards your face or head, and then alerts you with a subtle vibration. The band has an LED system that lights up to count the number of times that\u2019s happened. We\u2019ve taught Nudge to recognise over 1,000 hand and arm gestures, so it should always know where your hand is in relation to your face and head. And as smart as Nudge is, we love the fact that it works straight out of the box, no need to calibrate it or hook it up to an app. As soon as nudge arrives, it can be charged up, and users pop it straight on their wrist to start their training sessions.",

DARC combines an innovative patented biologic with a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and uses standard imaging equipment to identify cellular level disease activity. DARC Technology can be used to measure the impact of current and future therapeutics and interventions by assessment of disease activity whilst identifying non-responders to existing and new interventions, resulting in the avoidance of costly, ineffective or un-required medical management. DARC helps to stratify patients in clinical trials, resulting in the creation of enriched patient cohorts, consisting of those at highest risk of rapid disease progression. DARC has been developed by Professor M Francesca Cordeiro at University College London through Wellcome Trust funding and is now approved as an exploratory biomarker by the FDA & MHRA. Following further analysis of Phase II data, several other indications may follow, including Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, Diabetes Mellitus and Cancer.

      "description": "Well if you are like many engineers and manufacturers you've won an onslaught of hype, buzzwords, and a glimmer of hope that you can start evolving your operations with new technology to improve your business outcomes. As you start to consider that digital transformation, here are 5 reasons why you should consider QiO as part of that plan- because buzzwords alone aren't going to solve your problems. 1. QiO empowers clients to drive value-based innovation by removing the burdens of legacy software vendor requirements, dependency and thinking. Steadfast in our commitment to the success of our clients, QiO does not lock companies into perpetual software licenses, embed immovable consulting teams, or monetise our client's customer database. Simply, our clients own their data, customers, and innovation... the way it should be. See our Chairman Rick Haythornthwaite expand on these ideas in a recent interview with SkyNews. QiO Foresight IIoT Platform is built from the ground up by industrial engineers for industrial engineers to dramatically improve operational efficiency, productivity, and safety. Applications are infused with artificial intelligence, provide smart automated workflows for team collaboration and scale across your production and supply chain. Ingredients matter. QiO Foresight IIoT enables industrial and manufacturing teams to problem-solve, experiment and redefine production assumptions in real-time. The platform is built to securely accommodate any data, any asset, any source, at any scale, and on any cloud - edge, private, hybrid or public. Your problems don't live in silos, your applications shouldn't either. See how Rolls-Royce is using QiO to improve their outcomes. 4. QiO is the only company providing industrial engineers with a self-learning digital twin, PARCS\u00ae Profile, that is not limited by static slices of point-in-time views and becomes smarter with each deployed Foresight Suite\u00ae application. The profile uses design, manufacturing and operations data to create a single lexicon defined by five real-world factors - Performance, Availability, Reliability, Capacity and Serviceability. To further secure data and provide traceability across the supply chain, each profile is encapsulated with a unique blockchain key. Fast-track your digital program. 5. Digital progress usually requires a shift in organisational inertia to foster an Industry 4.0 culture. Having an experienced industrial partner who can aid in framing ambitions, navigating challenges and providing purpose-built tools is a must have on this journey. No more time and money wasted to procure and install compute, network and storage infrastructure or manage resource-intensive vendor contracts. It's time to demand more. These are just a few of the numerous reasons why you should make QiO your partner for your digital transformation. If you'd like to get started on your digital transformation journey try Foresight Performance\u00ae risk-free.",

One brain trying to tell 100,000 hands just doesn't work. Founded by two McKinsey alums in 2016, Quorso's AI was created to unlock human ingenuity. Frontline teams at multi-site businesses run more than half of the global economy. They are a powerful group with the experience, expertise, and heart to make their businesses successful. But all too often, these managers work as cogs in an engine, with limited visibility into their business and not a ton of flexibility to make decisions. We're here to change all that - to bridge the divides between data, disparate teams, and hierarchical organisations. Your company's brightest intelligence isn't artificial.",

      "description": "PolyChord is a spinout from Cambridge University, formed in 2017 to commercialise the unique and cutting-edge analytical data tool developed by two cosmology professors (Professor Mike Hobson & Professor Anthony Lasenby) both now directors of the company. The data they had to deal with came from the Planck satellite and went from the present day to the Big Bang, spanning ten billion years. The tool, PolyChord, successfully extracted the desired information from that data - and we now look to apply it to commercial instances where there are similar Big Data problems with issues of high dimensionality, many variables, complexity, and dirtiness. Many people these days claim to have smart data tools - PolyChord is a genuine step change ahead of the rest and can fit models to data when the task is exceptionally challenging, in order to extract information and make predictions. We have made progress by collaborating with large, dynamic successful companies, who have gathered data, prepared it for analysis, but have then run into difficulties with the number of variables, and high dimensionality. Fitting traditional models to extract this information is then impossible - this is where our PolyChord tool really delivers, and global optimisation is also achievable in many circumstances. PolyChord has this year been used to optimise neural networks, where we treat the honeycomb-like surface of the neural network as a high dimensional data problem in its own right and solve it using PolyChord. The result is PolyNet, a second tool for the company, and a new way of using neural networks for more accurate Machine Learning. For more information on current and upcoming projects, visit our PolyChord Blog.",

We created Phebi so quantitative and qualitative researchers could better understand what's in people's heads and hearts. Simple, affordable, and quick-to-deploy, Phebi empowers researchers to collect and analyze what people say, gain insights they can't get any other way, and better predict behavior. Phebi's award-winning software has two main parts: - A plugin that makes it easy to voice-enable any survey and improve the user experience. And, when people talk instead of type they say more, especially on mobile. - A portal that makes it easy to explore, analyze and visualize what people have said (transcription), how they said it (sentiment analysis), and how they felt about what they said (emotion analysis). It also makes it easy to tell the story in the data. Phebi provides emotion and sentiment scores to quantify the qualitative at scale. It enables researchers to use AI-generated tags and apply their own to identify and dig into subgroups and topics. And, Phebi identifies where peak emotion is expressed and facilitates downloading audio clips. In addition to data collected via the plugin, Phebi supports data collection via phone surveys and does analysis of long-form audio captured at call centers and through qualitative work like focus groups and IDIs.

There are many photographers present, they are all running around and taking photos of everyone. You pose - the flash goes off, and you just walk away. It is very likely that you will never see that photo of you. If you are at a wedding, and if the bride/groom is a close friend of yours maybe they will send you a few photos eventually. The photographer approaches you, shows a single photo that he has printed of yours. It is not a flattering photo, but you will purchase it anyways, because you want a memory of this night. You will try to take a photo of the photo to share on Instagram, but the photo will look either blurry or the flash will go off making the whole thing impossible. The night is young. You have a pocket or a tiny clutch and a photo that doesn't fit into it. By the time you get home tonight, there will be many drink stains on that photo. You are also very likely to lose it, or to end up with someone else's photo. We at Photier hate this scenario. We think photos should be viewed instantly. And that is what we do. We make sure that we simplify all the steps in between the click, and you receiving the photo. The face recognition system takes a minute to recognise your face in the pool of thousands of people. We can recognise you from the smallest detail on your face. We send you the photo and that's it. The photo doesn't come with extra baggage. You can store it, stare at it, or post it - it's all up to you. Photier can be used in all kinds of events where a DSLR camera is being used. This may be at a wedding or a graduation, a ski resort or a private baby shower to name a few. As long as there are photos that need to go to their owners we can help. We like to think that the sky is the limit, and we work very hard to make that true.",

We understand that shareholders and the public are becoming increasingly intolerant of project failure, particularly when it is often foreseeable and avoidable. We exploit the very latest techniques in AI and machine learning to leverage the knowledge and insights from a vast array of interconnected project data; identifying and joining dots in a way that until recently would have been unimaginable. This has the potential to transform how organisations develop their project delivery capability and in our opinion will deliver the most significant change to project delivery in a generation. Projecting Success are helping to shape the thinking on what is an incredibly complex but hugely exciting emergent capability. We use the insights from connected data to provide early warnings, suggested courses of action, interventions, checklists and contextualised feedback to help project delivery experts navigate their way dynamic and rapidly evolving project environments. Examples include extracting real time insights from market and contract data, integrating this with tender documentation and aligning the rich seam of bid data that exists within organisations. We also provide tailored insights on the profitability and delivery challenges from previous projects and use the insights from this experience to shape future bids; an intelligent and adaptive bid management capability. The capability then extends into intelligent scheduling, using deep learning to identify correlations in performance across each element of the work breakdown structure, across thousands of projects. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. Our capabilities are truly revolutionary.",

      "description": "Logic Programming Associates (LPA) is a company specializing in logic programming and artificial intelligence software. LPA was founded in 1980 and is widely known for its range of Prolog compilers and more recently for VisiRule. LPA was established to exploit research at Imperial College, London into logic programming carried out under the supervision of Prof Robert Kowalski. One of the first implementations made available by LPA was micro-PROLOG which ran on popular 8-bit home computers such as the Sinclair Spectrum and Apple II. This was followed by micro-PROLOG Professional one of the first Prolog implementations for MS-DOS. As well as continue with Prolog compiler technology development, LPA has a track record of creating innovative associated tools and products to address specific challenges and opportunities. In 1989, LPA developed the Flex expert system toolkit, which incorporated frame-based reasoning with inheritance, rule-based programming and data-driven procedures. Flex has its own English-like Knowledge Specification Language (KSL) which means that knowledge and rules are defined in an easy-to-read and understand way. In 1992, LPA helped set up the Prolog Vendors Group, a not-for-profit organization whose aim was to help promote Prolog by making people aware of its usage in industry.

With immediate, fully objective and in-depth results, teachers can then work with our dedicated intervention package to support both emerging and fluent readers in their development. Following 30 years of academic research at the Karolinska Institute, which has selected the Nobel laureates in Physiology and Medicine since 1901, we first launched our unique method of measuring reading attainment in Sweden in 2015. After a successful entrance into the US in 2017, we then launched in the UK early in 2018. Our work across the globe is still driven by the same overarching commitment to education and literacy upon which Lexplore was founded many years ago. Literacy skills are fundamental to so much of school life and beyond, yet in the UK almost 148,000 children still leave primary school unable to read well. Our mission from the start was to provide teachers with the technology, resources and information needed to identify those struggling readers early and raise attainment for all pupils. Since 2015, our assessment has undergone much further development. Today, having conducted more than 200,000 tests across the UK, US, Sweden and internationally, we have featured heavily in the press, including on BBC News, been nominated for BETT, E-Assessment and ERA awards, and have been ranked 8th in Europe\u2019s top 50 most innovative companies! We are also extremely proud that our assessment and interventions are helping to the bridge the literacy gap globally!

      "description": "Using unique Artificial Intelligence, JobRocket helps job seekers get closer to the interview stage by helping them optimise their CVs and bypass the restrictive Applicant Tracking Systems now used by the majority of employers. Employers use complex applicant tracking systems to search for keywords in CVs and match them against the job description. The closer the match, the more likely someone is to get an interview. Or, to put it another way, if the CV doesn\u2019t contain the words the applicant tracking system is looking for, the chances of being selected are very low indeed. JobRocket has analysed hundreds of thousands of job ads, CVs and applicant tracking systems to develop a unique algorithm that helps candidates improve their job match score instantly. Once job seekers upload their CV and apply for jobs on the JobRocket website (JobRocket is linked to major recruitment websites and has access to tens of thousands of jobs), the machine learning algorithm instantly evaluates key elements in the CV against the position advertised. It then generates a match score and constructive feedback on how to tailor the CV to get through the employers\u2019 Applicant Tracking Systems and rank highly in recruiter searches.",

Over the past 3 years we\u2019ve evolved from home-made smart socket prototypes and basic software into the market-ready certified \"m.e Platform\" with integral Machine Learning. It's the ultimate building control, automation and management system to eliminate waste. The m.e Platform focuses on Small Power, sometimes known as Plug Load power, which can account for up to 40% of a commercial buildings\u2019 energy consumption. No system in any building can measure, control or automate Small Power in any useful way. Did you know that between 25% to 50% of Small Power can be classified as wasted energy and GHG emissions? This wastage comes from occupant devices left switched-on or in standby to large water heaters and devices being-on overnight for no reason. For any organisation wishing to be \u2018net-zero\u2019 Small Power waste must be addressed. The m.e Platform is designed to simply fit into this infrastructure and management gap, automatically identifying Small Power wasted energy and controlling it, reducing total energy costs and GHG emissions by up to 50%. Unlike others' efforts to fill the gap, we\u2019ve created a hardware and software system that\u2019s accurate, safe and effective. Our self-designed m.e Power Socket is a like for like replacement for any normal power socket or fused spur, is low cost and lasts for at least 10 years. Our Software is cloud based and features our own Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to identify what\u2019s plugged-in, what state the device is in, and whether or not its wasted energy. We can eliminate wasted energy loads by simply switching-off, using it for Demand Side Response (DSR), or targeting use to maximise carbon/cost efficiency.",

      "description": "Founded in an Edinburgh kitchen by a group of data scientists in 2012, TVSquared has become a multinational organization that's changed the way advertisers measure and optimize TV. For advertisers, the success or failure of TV campaigns was based on out-of-date, inaccurate information. TV ads were always bought and designed around ratings data - received about six weeks after a spot aired. Advertisers had no way of knowing crucial details about what spot worked best, on what network, on what day, during what time of day, etc. For a $202 billion global industry, TV advertising had no accurate way of measuring and optimizing TV. Our team of data scientists, many who spent most of their careers in fintech and e-commerce, found out about the lack of timely data analysis for TV advertising and set out to solve that problem by turning TV into an optimizable marketing channel. Today, more than 600 brands, agencies and networks in 60+ countries use TVSquared. Whether it's determining the effectiveness of a single spot, improving the performance of on-air campaigns, optimizing media spend, informing planning and buying or understanding the total impact of TV, TVSquared has succeeded in making it all possible.",

      "description": "When it comes to professional Face Recognition, we at Track-a-face understand the complexities of this technology. From the types of cameras required, the ideal positioning of those cameras and how the software can be set up to maximise the return on the investment. Face detection is generally a term used for cameras and digital recording devices to pick out the characteristics of the human face and then put a coloured box around it. This is often then used as a trigger or an alarm of some sort to activate the system or bring to the operators attention that a face / person has been detected. Often these systems can only work on a small number of faces at a time with one frame of video. This is also the technology employed in mobile phones and gaming consoles. Face recognition is now common place in many domestic applications, in laptops it is used to to recognise the person logging in and to perform the login automatically, smart TV's utilise the technology to provide the viewer with a preferred channel listing. Track-a-face is a professional surveillance tool for government, town centre surveillance, shopping malls and other high footfall areas. The major difference between track-a-face products and its domestic relatives, is its processing speed. The software is developed over many years by Herta in Spain and is capable of processing 40 or more faces in a continuous video feed. It will detect ALL the faces, analyse ALL the faces and compare them with its database of known people. If it finds a match it will then trigger an alarm and bring up a picture of the detected person the picture from the saved database and the details of the person that are held on file. Providing the cameras are set correctly, the system has been shown to be more than 95% accurate.",

Included are analytical dashboard for the gym operators, showing where they have equipment bottlenecks, resulting in customers having to wait for equipment, causing \"unmet demand\" and unhappy customers. The analytics will also identify where operators have too much, or unpopular equipment, that is using up precious rented floor space and capacity. TrackMyGym focus is on multi- site operators who can move equipment between sites to maximise their Return on Investment, both in gym equipment, and their rented gym floor space. TrackMyGym is also working on a white labelled app that enables Gym Operators to share with their customers how busy all of the equipment is, with the ability to filter per hour, per day, per each individual piece of equipment. Permanent attachment of the sensors on the equipment will also open the door to gym customers being able to track their own workouts, and work has begun on creating a white labelled app for the gym operators to enable this. Short term \"deep dive projects\" will also be available to operators that want in depth analysis, including customer surveys and consultant advise, before spending a lot of money buying new equipment for refurbishments.",

Our platforms bring together communities of customers and partners, including developers and are enabling new levels of collaboration between companies from different industry sectors. This approach has historically resulted in the conception of entirely new ways of solving problems and delivering services. Our solution is built on the very foundation that in 5 years\u2019 time we may have a radically different way of gathering traffic flow information. With research projects we want to go further than just integrating with all data, but ask the question; why could a car not tell a signal as it passes what it was like where it has been and what it is like now? The car could also tell the signal where it is going, helping it make a decision about which stage to give priority to. Why could the signal not then tell the car what the traffic is like on its way and how going a different route may be more efficient? This technology is here today and our approach, architecture and technology will mean these advances are simple upgrades not complete changes to the very fundamentals of systems deployed. TrafficSignals.ai vision is to challenge impossible positions and provide an innovative and deeply integrated approach to intelligence around big data, internet of things and other sources of data.

Our products put intelligent self-analytic capabilities in the systems-on-chip (SoCs) at the heart of today's consumer electronic, computing and communications products. Our embedded analytics technology helps solve the most pressing problems faced by the high-tech industries today - including cybersecurity, functional safety, and the management of complexity. Our solutions also allow designers to develop SoCs - the driving force behind both performance improvement and cost reduction in the electronics business - more quickly and cost-effectively. UltraSoC's flagship product line is a suite of semiconductor IP that puts an intelligent analytics infrastructure into the core hardware of an SoC. This provides intimate visibility of the real-world behavior of entire systems. The ultimate benefits include robustness against malicious intrusions; enhanced product safety; reduced system power consumption; and overall better performance - with fine-tuning of end products even after they are deployed in the field. These capabilities address applications in a broad range of market sectors, from automotive and IoT products, to at-scale computing and communications infrastructure. Our products are used by leading names including HiSilicon (Huawei), Imagination Technologies, Movidius (now Intel) and PMC-Sierra (now Microsemi) to bring these proven hardware-embedded benefits to their customers. Our partners include Andes, ARM, Baysand, Cadence/Tensilica, CEVA, Codasip, Lauterbach, MIPS, NetSpeed, Percepio, Roa Logic, SiFive, Syntacore and Teledyne LeCroy. UltraSoC's technology also has a substantial impact on the increasingly-pressurized economics of the semiconductor industry. Traditional SoC development methodologies have failed to keep pace with escalating systemic complexity, creating a \u2018productivity gap'. Our intelligent analytics technology closes that gap, giving engineering teams actionable insights that shorten the total development cycle time, accelerate debug, and reduce risk and cost to ensure timely market entry. Analysis from SemiCo research demonstrates the bottom-line value of this approach - SoC design teams can double their profitability and reduce their development costs by a quarter by using UltraSoC. UltraSoC is an active member of the RISC-V consortium, which aims to encourage the use of a new open source processor architecture which has been dubbed \u201cthe Linux of semiconductors\u201d. The company was named one of the 100 most exciting companies in the UK in the 2016 Mishcon de Reya / CityAM \u201cLeap 100\u201d list, and by Gartner as one of its 2016 \u201cCool Vendors\u201d.

If we achieve our mission, then we believe that one day we can use a virtual workforce to simplify businesses that enable people to utilise their creativity and apply their human touch to the business. Businesses suffer from enormous complexity of their processes and systems, and this grossly impacts on their ability to deliver solutions. We've all come to accept these inefficiencies as the norm. In the era of RPA and intelligent automation, we will start to look back and wonder how we ran our businesses in this manner. Virtual workers can support business goals in bringing together remote teams, and transform how people interact, by removing the mundane tasks that complicate or add distraction to a person's day. We believe in a world where machine intelligence and people work in unison, it builds a happier and greatly improved business efficiency. It will be the companies who adopt RPA, Machine Learning and the Virtual Workforce early, who start to dominate the market in terms of their financial performance and speed. We're at the point where these advanced technologies, formerly of science fiction, are now science fact.",

      "description": "Market leaders in contract acceleration. The problem with contract negotiation is that it is slow and inefficient, and therefore expensive. Each individual lawyer can waste hundreds of hours per year reading every word in every contract when most of the language is common and represents little or no risk. Once a lawyer has read the contract and understood the key issues, managing those issues to resolution is manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. Creating an issue list each time is difficult, time-consuming, and hard to maintain, so keeping stakeholders informed and collaborating on issues with colleagues is handled via email and phone calls. As a result, negotiations often descend into \u2018redlining battles\u2019 and interminable iterations of back and forth. The key to efficient contracting is the rapid discovery of issues, and effective management of the negotiation around those issues. Our technology uses AI to identify issues based on your playbook, previously signed agreements, and agreements negotiated by others. And it does so in minutes. You can then triage agreements, rapidly create and maintain issues lists, and collaborate with colleagues, empowering your lawyers to negotiate with more confidence and close deals faster with less risk. We intend to banish the phrase 'stuck in legal' from the vocabulary of business.

Traditional \"social listening\" software does a great job with quan data (likes, shares and impressions) but has never been good at understanding the text. Their word clouds are meaningless and their abstract sentiment scores are unactionable. Even the latest NLP models and techniques\u2014from Google Bert to GPT-3\u2014are only good for a narrow range of use cases or require manual model-training by advanced data scientists. As a result, big brands have had no way of understanding what their customers really think, not just on social but in reviews, customer complaint data, surveys and chat. Wordnerds is different. Founded by linguists, our SaaS platform builds on the very latest AI/NLP techniques, but does so through the lens of advanced corpus linguistics. The result is a user-trainable model that genuinely understands language. We group ideas by meaning\u2014not vocabulary\u2014and link sentiment to topics. We know that \"the 08:05 from Paddington is late\" and \"my train still hasn't arrived\" are the same problem articulated using different words. We understand that \"this water tastes like crap\" is an issue for a utility company and \"this crap tastes like water\" is a problem for Budweiser.

It creates a detailed profile of anything that has some text attached to it, from products (via descriptions, reviews), to brands (through news, social mentions etc.), and people (via their social media usage). The profiles are then automatically analysed to deliver brand, advertising and market research insight. For instance we help brands to understand who their social audience is, how the brand is perceived, how their marketing activities impact their perception, what kind of users are more responsive to specific messages/products and how campaigns can be optimised to attract and engage the right audience... without resorting to lengthy and costly consumer surveys. Take another example, by analysing how people talk about a specific brand/product in real time, our technology enables the monitoring of brand/products/campaigns on any arbitrary dimensions, e.g. \"trustworthiness\", \"livelyness\", \"masculinity/femininity\".

High-definition fault-finding technology for the next generation of smart Heat Pumps, and Air Conditioners. We provide usage information and product utilisation directly via a web portal app or dashboard to an existing BMI. Verv has created an AI-based predictive maintenance isolator suite for Heat Pump, Air Conditioners, and other large electrical loads, called Verv Connect \u2122 Verv's high-resolution predictive maintenance technology is integrated into a microchip in the Verv isolator and detects anomalies in how a Heat Pump or Air Conditioner is performing. Verv Connect \u2122 provides energy monitoring for accurate energy utilisation, can identify component fatigue signs and locate faults occurring or are about to occur in the utmost detail through real-time monitoring. This early detection capability allows quick intervention to minimise equipment failure and expensive repair costs. The high resolution at which we capture and analyse appliance data means that we have a detailed image of performance, allowing us to identify behaviour that cannot be detected with sensors or lower resolution monitoring. With the addition of artificial intelligence, we can train our algorithms to detect faults that may previously have gone unidentified. By detecting issues in the Heat Pumps, and Air-Con early, Verv can make them more energy efficient, longer lasting and more sustainable. The remote diagnostics tool allows equipment manufacturers to benefit from an enhanced consumer experience, a reduction in the significant costs associated with repairs in warranty and new and innovative business models. We've won multiple awards including Future City Technology of the year, Meaningful Business 100 and Technology Innovation of the year.",

      "description": "Warwick Warp was founded as a spin-off from the University of Warwick. Its founders included Professor Roland Wilson from the Signal and Image Processing Research Group in the Department of Computer Science. Professor Wilson's research group is widely known as one of the best of its kind in the UK and has earned international recognition. Warwick Warp was born out of an interest in three dimensional distortion or \"warping\" of fingerprints. Distortion can occur when a print is collected either intentionally, such as at a port of entry, or forensically from the scene of a crime. This problem, and others such as low image contrast, scars and cuts can make fingerprint matching a very difficult process. By taking a new, inventive approach, Warwick Warp's novel and patent protected mathematical modelling technology that can neutralise these effects and substantially improve the success rate of fingerprint matching. This completely new approach to fingerprint matching exceeds established accuracy benchmarks and delivers ultra-high accuracy for all types of fingerprints. The performance has been independently verified (NIST PFT and ELFT tests) as being among the most accurate available. Warwick Warp's algorithms deal especially well with low-quality or partial fingerprints including: shift distortion, rotation distortion, elastic distortion, scratches, low contrast, smudges, problem skin types and low minutiae counts. We specialise in developing innovative software products that enable integrators and developers to incorporate highly accurate fingerprint matching into their solutions. The fingerprint matching technology is made available as Software Development Kits (SDK) and SDK has been optimised to address the requirements of specific markets: AFIS, police (latent prints) and standard LiveScan applications (access control etc.).",

At the same time, the litigation rate for US companies rose to 9%, and 5% for non-US companies, the highest rates since 2006. Media coverage of these securities class actions has a direct impact on stock price volatility. On days when the media reported that shareholders were suing a company, there was a 19% increase in the daily volatility of those stocks. By combining stock price data, media coverage, and class action filings, our machine learning models detect when a company is at an increased risk of a securities class action and can help attribute stock price declines to specific business events.",

      "description": "In 1987 we began as a hobbyist group in our Founder's attic in London, where we were trying to create a walking, bipedal robot. Without warning, Honda revealed they had created Asimo, the world's first walking robot (which meant that our biped turned out to be Europe's first walking robot). Our biped was primitive and nowhere near as sophisticated as Asimo, so we abandoned the project (the prototype can now be seen on display in the Science Museum). We turned our attention away from feet and legs, and thought about hands. This was our starting point, to create the world's first, and best, robot hands. What helped us to develop this idea was realising that it's also easier for humans to understand how to control robots remotely via teleoperation, if the robot took the same form as the human hand. We formally registered as the Shadow Robot Company in 1997 and has since evolved into one of the longest running robotics companies in the UK, developing dexterous robotics manipulation technologies (\u2018hands for robots') and using them to solve real world problems. We have produced the world's finest anthropomorphic dexterous robotic hand, often used in research and testing, as well as developing our Smart Grasping System for the manufacturing industry.

In addition to owners benefiting from having an infection free website, they will also be incentivized by a tokenomics model to contribute value in terms of witnessed attack data to the distributed network. SharkGate is revolutionizing the cybersecurity arena by providing an open, intelligent and incentivized website protection as well as the decentralization of all generated threat information to the blockchain. Provides unrivaled hacker protection as well as a 24/7 malware scanner. Powered using the collective intelligence of the SharkGate AI (\u201cDeep Sea\u201d) and the SharkGate Website Threat Defence Database (\u201cWTDD\u201d). We are embracing the future of the internet and jumping ahead of all existing players in the industry by evolving our hacker protection from centralized firewall services (Web 2.0) to utilizing decentralized and distributed firewall applications (Web 3.0). Coordinates the memory of each attack encountered on any site worldwide and thus enables any site on the distributed network to mount a strong response if the attack is attempted again. Using techniques based on the human immune system it creates \u2018adaptive' rules that evolve as an adaptation to threats received and prepares for future similar, but yet unseen, attacks. An open, decentralized cybersecurity threat intelligence store powered by the blockchain. Growing more intelligent with every site that joins the network and as more existing threat data feeds and data providers join the ecosystem",

      "description": "Sequestim Ltd started as a joint collaboration between Cardiff University and QMC Instruments Ltd in 2016 to commercialise the next generation of terahertz imaging technology developed by the partners for security screening applications. Our walk-through scanners use space technology to image human body heat. Computer learning (AI) allows the scanner to distinguish between threats and non-threats but without the need for passengers to keep still or remove outer clothing. The scanner combines a number of world-leading technologies. The human body acts as a source of \u201clight\u201d by which the new scanner can see hidden objects which appear as a shadow. This is in contrast with existing scanners which process reflected and scattered radiation from a source within the machine. Sequestim scanners allow passengers to walk normally through security without the need to take off coats and jackets, or to remove personal items such as phones. It can also see inside moving curtain-sided lorries. The detector technology was originally developed to study the most distant astronomical phenomena. Its inventors want to know more about how stars are born from gigantic clouds of gas and dust. The scanner detects millimetre-waves, which are just like the light we see with our eyes, but at more than a thousand times longer wavelength. The ability of the scanner to reveal hidden objects has also attracted interest from Border Force, responsible for the UK\u2019s frontline border control operations at air, sea and rail ports. Images from the new scanner do not show anatomical details so there are no ethical issues. In addition, the Sequestim is designed so that the whole system will operate automatically, and no-one will see the images generated. Finally, the passenger is not exposed to potentially harmful radiation like x-rays.",

This is also critical for the testing of ADAS and Autonomous Vehicles, where the behaviour of the vehicle being simulated must correlate closely with the real-world vehicle. rFpro's accurately modelled Digital-Twins ensure that the virtual sensors, such as cameras and LiDAR, are subject to heave, pitch and roll as the simulated vehicle drives over accurately replicated bumps in the road and also while braking and cornering.",

      "description": "Stable was designed and built with a very simple goal; to protect farms around the world from volatile commodity prices. Stable came to life after our founder completed a Nuffield Farming Scholarship on the 'Simplification of Financial Risk Management for Farmers'. Richard's initial work received invaluable support from academics at the Universities of Harvard, Liverpool, Lisbon and Wellington, NZ as well as some of the world's largest insurers. Still run from a farm in Somerset, the Stable team now includes some of the world's leading Mathematicians, Agricultural Economists and Insurers. In 2015 we began work to build the platform that would become Stable. This was no easy task and required sophisticated algorithms and machine learning expertise to make Stable a reality. The scale of the challenge meant we also needed the extraordinary skills of the Virtual Engineering Centre in Liverpool and the use of one of Europe's most powerful computers. With the help of our global insurance partners and over 300 farmers, by 2018 we finally had the ability to deliver a simple, affordable and low risk way for farmers to manage volatile commodity prices. Our story has started in the UK, but plans are already well advanced to take Stable further afield. If you'd like to get involved in our story, then we'd love to hear from you.

      "description": "At Speech Graphics we specialize in one of the holy grails of computer facial animation: automatic, accurate lip sync. Given audio, our task is to create the illusion that the animated face you see is the source of the sound you hear. This illusion is notoriously difficult to achieve: the movements of speech are fast, complex and subtle, and viewers are highly sensitive to any mismatch between the face and the voice. Our world-class pipeline incorporates powerful speech analysis and procedural animation techniques to achieve this illusion consistently, allowing animators to handle overwhelming demand for high-quality dialogue. But Speech Graphics goes beyond good lip sync. Speech contains energy and emotion, and that too can be decoded from the voice and synchronized in the face. Using all available acoustic information, our algorithms drive not just the mouth but the entire face from audio input, from syllables to scowls. This is an interdisciplinary problem and Speech Graphics has a unique fusion of expertise in speech technology and computer animation found nowhere else in the world. Our team brings together decades of research into phonetics, task dynamics, speech recognition, psychology, machine learning, computer graphics, physical models and more. And we have solved the problem of how best to apply our systems to real-world facial rigs.",

      "description": "Thanks to the development of Speclipse Spectra-Scope\u00ae, a nearly instantaneous skin cancer diagnosis is now workable for physicians. Spectra-Scope\u00ae is a lightweight, portable device that detects the biochemical information of skin tissue using laser-induced plasma spectroscopy (LIPS). It comes with a deep-learning AI-based diagnostic algorithm for fast and accurate oncological diagnosis. Each emission spectrum of skin tissue acquired using LIPS has over 4000 parameters, providing detailed biochemical information of the tissue. The spectral patterns of the skin tissue\u2019s emission spectra vary under different medical conditions. Spectra-Scope\u00ae\u2019s deep learning-based proprietary diagnostic algorithm differentiates the conditions of BCC, SCC and malignant melanoma with high accuracy. The diagnostic algorithm was constructed by a deep neural network trained with a total 5302 emission spectra. Spectra-Scope\u00ae is quick, safe and easy to use. To evaluate the degree of atypia in a lesion, measurements are performed on a reference area close to the lesion, as well as on the lesion itself. The procedure takes only a second, and the LIPS score and the corresponding clinical predictive value of the lesion are displayed within a few seconds. Spectra-Scope\u2019s\u00ae diagnostic accuracy has been proven by worldwide clinical studies in the United States and Australia. A series of clinical studies were used to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Spectra-Scope\u00ae. A deep learning-based algorithm was used to create a robust database of information, leading to ground-breaking accuracy in both sensitivity and specificity. The identification of skin cancers (BCC, SCC and malignant melanoma) vs. benign lesions were accurately diagnosed with 97.6% sensitivity.",

With over 35 years' experience between them, they started out as machine vision consultants offering training and installations of vision equipment. After discovering they could build more powerful and sophisticated processors than the ones they were installing from suppliers (at a comparable cost), they rapidly found that customers much preferred their machines. Consequently, SIGA was born. A decade later and the expanded SIGA team now operates throughout the UK, Europe and US, and has become the global leader in machine vision processors, installation, training and problem solving, designing solutions for other suppliers and manufacturers around the world. They have built a strong reputation on their ability to move and respond quickly, and on their ability to solve pretty much every conceivable machine vision problem creatively, with innovative applications, technology and solutions.

      "description": "Artificial intelligence company Signal have been awarded their second Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with the University of Essex, enabling them to disrupt the UK media monitoring market. Run by Innovate UK, Knowledge Transfer Partnerships are part-government-funded project-based collaborations between universities and businesses created to help UK companies innovate and grow. Projects are designed to address a specific challenge or business need and give companies access to academic expertise and a grant of up to two-thirds of the project cost. The focus of this latest KTP project between Signal and the University of Essex is to develop new techniques to extract and visualise insights from unstructured text files, instantly converting large volumes of data into engaging and easily digestible presentation formats. A postgraduate, who will act as the research associate and project manager, is in the process of being hired and the project is set to kick-off in Q3 2018 and run for 18 months. Professor Udo Kruschwitz, from the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at Essex, will be the Academic Lead. He said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faOur first KTP project has laid the groundwork for automatically processing, classifying and linking textual documents, and has evidently done so very successfully. We are now at a point where we will be moving from knowledge extraction to actual knowledge understanding and visualisation. This is the second KTP between the University of Essex and Signal, the first one in 2015 helped the company secure investment of over \u00ac\u00a35.8m. This played a pivotal and transformative role in the development of Signal's AI-powered media monitoring capabilities as well as the company's growth. Utilising the university's expertise in natural language engineering, Signal created techniques to retrieve, clean and analyse vast data sets consisting of millions of pieces of media content. Rob Walker, KTP Manager for this project from the University of Essex, said: \u201a\u00c4\u00faSignal has grown into a fantastic business, in an area of AI which is well-aligned to our research. In an era of fast news, fake news and ever-increasing demands on business to keep up with opinion; Signal Media offer an innovative solution using exceptionally developed technology. Building upon this capability, Signal now offers hyper-relevant, near real-time access to the world's news disrupting the UK media monitoring market and paving the way to further development of their product to support additional use cases. In fact, the partnership proved so successful that the graduate hired as the first KTP associate, Dr Miguel Martinez, is now co-founder and chief data scientist at Signal Media. The collaboration was acknowledged with an award for Best Partnership at the KTP awards at the 2015 Innovate UK conference.",

Our work giving AI emotional states also makes IVAs easier to train and allows us to put guide rails around generative conversational models - so that businesses can move away from simplistic tree-based chatbots with confidence.

Cambrian has developed a solution based on AI (artificial intelligence) that can be easily installed on robots - even retrospectively. The system consists of 2 cameras on the gripper, software based on AI and a control computer. Robots can thus be quickly programmed for complex new tasks - this makes it easy to use in batch-related production or for logistics tasks (e.g. through reliable BIN picking and component recognition). Thanks to the CAD data prepared by Cambrian, the system can reliably recognise and grip the components - pre-positioning with millimetre accuracy is completely unnecessary. Even the most varied lighting conditions do not present a challenge, our technology doesn\u2018t need structured light. We can recognize even transparent, black and shiny parts. The Prediction time is 200ms, this is the fastes System on the market! Programming is fairly using our software snd can be done in a few hours maximum. The system can be universally adapted to a wide range of robot types, such as KUKA, ABB, Universal Robots and other Robot Brands. Our contact person for you: Stephan Weiss stephan@caint.io",

      "description": "BYG Systems started life in 1983 as a software house, nestled in Nottingham University's Science Park. Our trio of directors got down to the business of making a name for the company in the robotics and manufacturing industry. It wasn't long before we were developing cutting-edge 3D simulation systems for major clients and research Universities. By the mid-1980s we were working flat-out to produce exciting technology, attending conferences and shows to demonstrate our robotics and simulation software. By 1989, we'd evolved and diversified into new media, developing and supplying authoring tools to create Computer Based Training. With our talented pool of staff and willingness to change with the world, we expanded into providing educational services: our first foray into e-learning as it is known today. Continued growth in the 1990s resulted in major projects in Governmental, Finance, Retail, Healthcare and Telecommunications sectors. Our unique blend of experience of strong learning design, software, simulation and 3D virtual reality allowed us to craft solutions in learning and assessment, which other companies were unable to do. Whilst we spend most of our day producing exciting blends of e-learning, we still keep a toe in the robotics industry, with clients based in UK and US. In fact, you can still check out our robotics simulations today. Today we're one of the most widely experienced companies in the e-learning market. What's more is that we are positioned amongst the top 5 e-learning companies in the UK and Europe, with clients based all over the world. We travel all over Mainlaind Europe (and beyond) to meet our clients and build great relationships that result in exciting learning projects. Our range of learning solutions for clients have been deployed to complex, global technical infrastructures and delivered in over 30 languages to date. We pay special attention to reflecting the diversity of global learner audiences as well as tailoring all learning to specific target audiences. And of course we support our clients with software and maintenance packages to ensure learning stays up to date and fully functional at all times. From our humble beginnings we have grown a great deal, now employing almost 100 staff across various departments and we are still expanding. Together we strive to produce the best possible solutions we can think of. This dedication is rewarded by happy customers as well as awards. We know that innovation, creativity and forward-thinking are staples of any successful learning company and we have always focused on these qualities during our company history, changing with the market and often being the catalyst for change ourselves. We want to offer our clients cutting-edge solutions and technology that accommodate today's demand of flexible, robust and globalised learning. We challenge ourselves to always become better, innovate and evolve so we can anticipate our clients' needs and then meet them better than anyone else. They say a problem shared is a problem halved. We're interested in finding out what's challenging your organisation and sharing our expertise, ideas and experience with you to find a solution together.",

      "description": "Using the latest computing powers and machine learning capabilities, Bubo predicts the optimum price consumers are willing to pay for your product. Pricing strategy has a direct impact on profits. Price is personal and based on value judgement. Pricing too high reduces demand. Pricing too low reduces profitability and how customers perceive value. Bubo wants to make things simple. We offer a price recommendation based on our pioneering approach of customer-based pricing. Improving pricing represents one of the largest opportunities to influence companies\u2019 profits. Smart customer value-based pricing is the key to increasing profits. CASE STUDY 1: 45% Net Margin Improvement A UK-based automotive parts distributor with tens of thousands of product ranges, with 200 branch managers offering constantly changing discounts, was suffering serious profit erosion. With the automated solution by Bubo.AI, the client experienced a 45% Net Margin Improvement. CASE STUDY 2: 19% Higher Profits In 9 Weeks An Italian wholesaler, relying on cost-plus pricing with managers giving individual discounts was causing enormous profitability erosion. Within 9 weeks a customer-based pricing strategy was rolled out across one region. Over 185 million calculations were made in a 9 week period. The outcome was a 19% increase in profit value compared to a test product group in the same region. *** PRIVACY POLICY Bubo.AI values your privacy.

Industries have been a prime contributor to this. Today more than ever, businesses need to understand their true carbon footprint with accuracy across the entire value chain. As they are coming under increased pressure to be operationally efficient while remaining ethical and socially responsible from regulatory bodies, consumer preferences & financial markets. To counteract that, industries will face increased carbon costs for the emissions footprint. As carbon pricing is mandated and regulatory requirements come into play, accurate carbon modeling will require a deeper understanding. Across Industrial GHG emissions, 80% of emissions on average is contributed by indirect Scope 3 across the value chain.

      "description": "Bidnamic is a marketing technology platform that helps retailers unlock the full potential of Google Shopping.. Standout had previously struggled to bring the volume of sales at a sustainable ROAS. The fashion industry is incredibly competitive and is dominated by big brands who have the budget to waste on generic search terms, pushing independent retailers off the Google Shopping carousel. Utilising the Bidnamic software, Standout has been able to compete with large fashion retailers, ensuring they are in front of the right customer, at the right price. Since working with Bidnamic, they have seen a 271% increase in ROAS and a 124% increase in conversion growth. Bidnamic's purchase intent engine ensures they are only bidding aggressively for terms likely to convert into a sale. Paying the optimal CPC per term ensures that Standout are maximising their ad-spend to its full efficiency.. Bidnamic was born out of our own frustrations with Google Shopping whilst scaling our own eCommerce marketplace, Dizinga. Bidnamic has enabled us to dominate Google Shopping profitably while eliminating the common problems associated with the platform.. The complexity of Google Shopping has gone beyond what a human can manage. Bidnamic overcomes this by combining advanced machine learning with human thinking to close the gap between where you are today - and where you want to be.. Standout launched in 2005, after the idea came about after a few beers in the local pub. Starting with only a few select designer brands, they now offer over 50 of the latest fashion brands, such as Superdry and Calvin Klein. They pride themselves on offering a large variety of the latest styles and trends in designer wear at the best price, without compromising on quality. Whether you want a designer t-shirt, hi-top shoes or a trendy accessory - you can find it all at Standout. Standout needed a solution that could help them stay competitive on Google Shopping whilst also increasing the volume of sales profitably.. The complexity of Google Shopping management has gone beyond what a human can manage. Bidnamic overcomes this by combining advanced machine learning with human thinking to close the gap between where you are today - and where you want to be.. Stitch & Story were wasting ad spend on genetic awareness terms such as \\u201cwool\\u201d, \\u201cyarn\\u201d. This is very common and very few companies using Google Shopping are aware of this. Bidnamic's purchase intent engine re-distributes ad-spend so that they only bid aggressively on terms that are likely to convert into a sale. The second challenge was the low average order value, as customers would place single item orders. Bidnamic increased the average order value by 52%. To do this, Bidnamic's machine learning technology first profiled every product to understand the relevant search terms and their performance. It then used this data to increase visibility for higher value products. Working with Bidnamic, Stitch & Story managed to increase their average order value by 52%, whilst driving brand awareness, resulting in a 19% increase in conversion rate.. \"]",

      "description": "CUBE, Autonomous Vehicles Security Platform based on Blockchain Autonomous cars rely heavily on wireless communication techniques, such as vehicle-to-vehicle, navigation route information, GPS, and other driving data. Autonomous cars continuously communicate with various sites to remotely monitor their internal and outside states. These various network accesses increase the risk of malicious attacks on autonomous vehicles. Cube solves the problem of these autonomous vehicles' security by using blockchain technologies, AI-based deep learning and quantum hash cryptography. In the future, the $770 billion autonomous automotive market will see Cube as the first user of blockchain-based security. We will provide an autonomous vehicle security platform to companies such as automotive manufacturers, and related firms, such as Google and Uber.",

      "description": "Curenetics is a fast-evolving and advancing start-up, working hard to defeat cancer using medical technology. Cancer treatment varies from patient to patient and many cancer types now require immune-oncologic treatment or other forms of targeted therapy. How a patient responds to their treatment regime is not fully known which can result in patients suffering from unwanted side effects or developing potentially life-threatening immune-mediated toxicities. We are currently working towards developing cancer treatment response models using artificial intelligence. We aim to predict response to immuno-oncologic treatments in cancer patients by leveraging our platform\u2019s capability to find features within a large array of asynchronous clinical and genomic data. We are identifying biomarkers that will predict response to immunotherapy, even before starting treatment. At the same time, Curenetics is also building a flagship AI model to match cancer patients to the right clinical trial, whatever stage of treatment you are in. Through our machine learning-driven algorithms, domain expertise, and ability to combine cancer molecular profiling data, we are giving patients hope by helping to recruit them to the most suitable clinical trials available. At the same time, supporting trial sponsors to meet their recruitment targets, saving costs, and reducing time to trial completion.",

Our founders, James and Paul, are proven technology innovators. Their close working partnership stretches back 15 years, creating their first business during the fallout of the infamous dotcom crash - and defying the industry climate to create software appreciated by clients in well over a dozen different markets. In 2012, we decided to build on our earlier success. With a deep recession as the backdrop for our latest challenge, our ambition became to use artificial intelligence (AI) to drive up conversion rates - and cloud.IQ was born. We evolved our powerful software to create a cost-effective conversion-rate optimisation (CRO) solution for ecommerce operators. Our creation struck a chord, and we became one of London's fastest-growing tech start-ups. Since then, we've doubled our growth every year, and in early 2017 we secured a further round of funding, led by London-based pan-European fund Nauta Capita. This latest investment underpins our rapid growth path, and will fuel the development of new products. We will also hire key new talent and fast-track our global expansion plans - enabling us to better understand and serve our customers, in all parts of the world. Led by AI and using machine learning, innovation of the cloud.IQ platform continues apace. We're determined to ensure that all ecommerce companies are able to benefit from cloud.IQ's ability to significantly increase revenues at greatly reduced costs - and to maintain our platform's position as the most efficient solution available. We started cloud.IQ because we had an excellent product and the desire to find a new working model. We wanted to create a business that is sustainable, provides long-term jobs, and supports our community.In a world dominated by internet giants, we wanted to level the ecommerce playing field. To develop tools that every size of organisation can afford. To make them fast, simple and effective. To make cloud.IQ - cost-effective conversion-rate optimisation for all.",

Most decisions in a third system don't have a clear-cut answer. Assessing the alternatives and the risks can be overwhelming made more difficult in stressful time sensitive situations. AI systems aren't able to build models for themselves by just observing correlations in huge masses of data - models need to see causation. And, would could solve lots of challenge areas in culture, productivity and performance.

We set out to build Aire to be the change we wanted to see. So this is very personal to us. And therefore our motivations are perhaps different to other types of companies. Our founders have often stated, publicly, that the problems we are solving might take us 20 years or more to solve. Therefore, since our incorporation, we have established core operating procedures and guiding principles that prepare us to survive, and indeed thrive through multiple business cycles. In spirit of transparency, we wanted to share the ideologies that we believe will help us get there. Aire will always be focused on the long run and this is reflected in our strategy. We make decisions that are rooted in strengthening the core operating fundamentals of our company, rather than seeking quick wins. We are aware, that our business environment will keep changing rapidly, which we have to be prepared for. Research is paramount to Aire and our work. The company will continue to invest actively in research-oriented collaborations and fellowships at universities in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine-learning, neuroscience and design interfaces. Much of our proprietary technology stems from the academic research of our founders. Our culture at Aire, places a strong emphasis on experimenting and the scientific process. Therefore we work hard to recruit people who embody that attitude and then train them further for the skills they need. We trust our people and our hiring practices (which might seem unconventional) but ensure that we preserve that culture.",

Software robots can execute complex instructions and crunch terabytes of data with speed and accuracy that no human can match. Further, modern AI-fuelled systems have very sophisticated, human-like skills - the ability to self-learn (cognitive), the ability to self-regulate (autonomic), the ability to connect the dots (creative). These capabilities are so transformative that they will fundamentally alter how everything is made, sold and consumed in the future. But transformation does not happen at 20,000 feet.

The AI constantly monitors the client thereby enabling coaches to engage with an increased volume of clients and monitor the clients progress whilst allowing the coaches to constantly asses client output and growth. The system also allows the coach to work in a virtual partnership with the Artificial Intelligence and prescribe near perfect bespoke digital coaching materials for clients. The Artificial Intelligence is powered by our proprietary DVC algorithm which allows coaches and clients to use their mobile devices to monetise or enhance their own digital metadata for their own use, in any area of their lives they wish from commercial to wellness to dating to finding a new job. \u201c33\u201d allows clients to take back control of their valuable digital DNA and utilise it directly thereby taking back control from the large social networks that mine and monetise this very same metadata. The Artificial Intelligence also encourages coaches to work together in partnership maximising their own strengths and building small collectives where clients move through each coaches\u2019 experience. For example, from a business goal through to fitness thereby allowing clients to move through the ecosystem constantly working on improving new areas of their lives.

We work closely with customers to develop innovative digital products, specialising in data-driven applications and conversational UI / chatbots. Our work is driven by new technology, user centred design and Agile methodologies. What makes us different is the team we work with; all our people are experts in their field and have world-class credentials to back it up. We are a small, specialised team and we offer a highly personal and collaborative service to our clients. We think creatively about technology and implement it strategically. We invest in new and interesting ideas and regularly release open-source code to the community. Our recent clients include the Bank of England, UEFA, NHS National Innovation Centre, Turner Broadcasting, Internews, and Mencap, along with a number of smaller organisations whom we love just as much. To find out about what we can do for you, give us a call or send us an email. John runs an agile, knowledgeable and experienced team of developers with a strong focus on enterprise, data-driven technical solutions. I have employed them for a recent, very challenging project mining the group associativity of social media networks. I was highly impressed by the way John runs his team, the agile way in which they approach the work and even more pleased with their ideas and technical input. I would recommend John and his team at Atchai to anyone who needs a competent solution for any data-oriented enterprise project. What I like about working with Atchai is that they take the time at the beginning of the project to understand the big picture before choosing the right tech stack for the job. What they delivered was cutting edge, very high quality software. All work was delivered on time, on budget, to a very high standard with clear, honest communication throughout. Atchai Digital created a highly innovative visualisation tool that successfully demonstrates the value of open health data on an imaginative open-source linked data platform. This step-change innovation, which was profiled extensively at an international semantic web conference and a Guardian review, represents an important contribution to health informatics. Atchai's ability to work in development sprints that result incompelling customer experiences is a clear signature. Having put together a very well thought out and concise proposal we chose Atchai to deliver a new framework to power websites and digital products for our growing general entertainment business and brands. John and his team came up with a technical approach which has proven to offer huge efficiencies in the production of TV channel support websites. We now have an underlying architecture which enables quick and efficient rollout of new websites, along with the tools to ensure that every site we produce is accessible across mobile devices. Atchai were extremely professional, patient, and showed a great understanding of our often changing requirements and priorities. Their Agile approach to development, along with regular and effective communication allowed us to accommodate change and react quickly to evolving business and user requirements. I'd highly recommend Atchai and wouldn't hesitate to work with them again.",

Whether you are operating drone patrols over marine reserves or monitoring static energy infrastructure, your ability to succeed depends on the supporting infrastructure used to coordinate any response. Today\u2019s machines are still mostly tools, not team mates. Our smart devices can be retrofitted to other machines to make them smarter and more resilient in a changing environment, independent from any infrastructure. Our Argonaut\u2122 AI cameras watch for poachers in Africa, oil thieves in South America or potential suicides on the European railways. Our GENIE\u2122 navigation units enable any drone to independently navigate and complete missions without GPS signals. We use the Cerebella\u2122 mission management platform to gather best-in-class machines from an ever-increasing catalogue of partners and to integrate them into a human-centred workflow. Cerebella\u2122 allows humans, AI, satellite analytics, robots, drones and IoT sensors to work together as part of a combined team in complex missions. These hybrid teams can respond faster and more effectively to safety or security threats over large remote areas. Whether it\u2019s cables being stolen, oil being tapped or elephants poached for ivory, we provide the ability for the security team to know before these incidents about to happen and immediately intervene or follow up.

We are proud to say our Opportunity Execution Project made the front page of the most-voted list in Stanford University's recent course on Technology Entrepreneurship. Contact us through our front page if you want to discuss it with us. Our technology leaves us many free parameters to develop ultra-efficient integrated circuits for machine learning in many deep algorithms. Help us shape and chose those parameters so we can design the best chip for your application. Please visit our application calls page and answer no more than 6 questions to give us your view of machine learning and the opportunity ultra-efficient hardware would give you or contact us to discuss your needs. People like Hermann Hauser, founder of ARM, and industry big hitters like IBM and Microsoft say machine learning is the next big wave in computing after smartphones. But machine learning today consumes huge resources and is trapped in warehouses full of hot computers. In 2012, Google needed 16,000 processors burning megawatts of power just to learn to see cats in videos. This inefficiency severely limits machine learning applications in autonomous systems like robots, unmanned vehicles or the billions of sensors the Internet of Things will bring. Even with cheaper graphical processing unit (GPU) implementations, these systems would simply be too big and hot or tethered to a warehouse and power station to be able to learn independently. So we see a great opportunity in bridging the efficiency gap. We believe we know how. We are Artificial Learning Ltd, working with top UK universities to develop novel, ultra-efficient silicon chips specifically for machine learning. We want to make machine learning thousands - perhaps millions - of times more efficient. Instead of needing a warehouse and a power station, our integrated circuit designs will enable powerful machine learning to be embedded in devices that can sit in the palm of your hand and run on batteries.",

Extreme susceptibility of quantum computation to noise is one of the crucial factors that hinder the development of large-scale quantum computers. By the means of optimising gate count in a quantum circuit, it is possible to significantly reduce hardware errors and increase the accuracy of quantum computation. Optimal (or near-optimal) circuit compilation is an extremely challenging and still open problem due to additional constraints imposed by hardware configuration, such as restricted qubit connectivity and hardware-native gate set. Arline project has been launched to optimise quantum algorithms with machine learning techniques. We believe that quantum-applied machine learning will make quantum algorithms run on NISQ computers and solve state-of-the-art computational problems.",

Unlike many corporate presentation tools which instruct people on \u201chow to\u201d present or speak in public, but often yield short term results, the gweek app - a \u201cpersonal communication coach\u201d - takes a more intuitive approach. Based on the belief that everyone is inherently Speech Intelligent, gweek helps harness the skills people already possess but don\u2019t necessarily know how to use, such as clarity and structure in speech. The software is comprised of learning levels, to help users achieve key milestones, or to simply provide help with rehearsing speech. gweek is a cognitive technology in that it knows what to listen and look for in order to help in a constructive, non-judgmental way. gweek uses audio and visual layers of machine learning to provide real-time analytics and bite-sized, micro-learning chunks. It empowers users to express themselves more effectively, and to tap into their most valuable currency \u2013 the way they present themselves. It empowers users to communicate \u2018with\u2019 not \u2018at\u2019 people. Through the use of smart Speech Intelligence Analytics\u00ae, gweek has been able to consistently measure the components that make up clear, confident, yet authentic communication - to create a system which accurately scores users in real-time and helps them to improve their speaking capabilities.

Many of the online communities are run in partnership with health organizations, non-profit organization's (NPO) and charities worldwide, including Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), British Liver Trust, Endometriosis UK and The Multiple Sclerosis Association Of America. Each month over 4M people from across the world come to the platform, the majority of which are from the UK and US. HealthUnlocked is in the top 20 private health websites globally according to Alexa Internet. HealthUnlocked is also available through an app for iPhone A study (2017) by University of Manchester concluded that use of the HealthUnlocked platform positively affects a persons Patient Activation Measure and research (University of Warwick, 2016) found use of platforms such as HealthUnlocked helps people to come together and cope with illnesses and diseases such as diabetes, cancer and mental health problems.

HealthUnlocked was one of the first companies selected to join NHS England's, NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA) programme, which aims to have proven innovations adopted faster and more systematically through the NHS, delivering on the commitment detailed within the Five Year Forward View. HealthUnlocked works with organisations including think tanks and the pharmaceutical industry to better understand long term health conditions and to recruit people from its online health communities to surveys, advisory boards and panels, as well as clinical trials. An academic review into patient involvement in drug development found that social media and peer networks are evolving to play a much deeper role in innovation and clinical research in industry and changing opportunities for patients to participate in research and development of new therapies. A study into patients experiences on steroids taken from data on the health platform found that the timing of glucocorticoid administration varies significantly in patients, potentially influencing effectiveness and side effects.

Over a minimum of a 5-year period, Fusionex will be deploying Big Data Analytics to increase the efficiency of its client\u2019s interaction with existing customers, as well as provide solutions to utilize available data in order to craft better offerings that would empower the client to capture newer markets. In order to gain a better outlook of the performance and health of the client\u2019s sales activities, a cost utilization analytics module will be provided by Fusionex. This will help the client inform its corporate customers about the performance of their corporate accounts \u2013 e.g. details such as how much cost has been utilized by staff, how much was claimed for spouses or dependents, and even illnesses involved and medical facilities visited. This will help corporate customers determine if their account is being fully or partially utilized, and whether or not coverage should be increased for their staff. The cost utilization analytics module can also be used by the client\u2019s team to generate new products that they can upsell and cross-sell to existing customers. Fusionex and the client will also be working closely together to formulate strategies to penetrate the insurance market through social media analytics and digital marketing. Capturing the right data in a timely manner is important for decision makers in the client\u2019s organization, to determine long term strategies as well as day to day actions. To achieve this, Fusionex GIANT 2017 (targeted for official release imminently) will not only accumulate and cleanse disparate datasets, but also be used to find historical patterns and predict future trends in data (structured, semi-structured and unstructured). Via GIANT, the client will be able to determine claim patterns of its customers and will be able to craft products that better cater to these customers, focusing on their specific needs. The client will also be able to cross sell products if they identify, for example, the trend of city dwellers \u2013 e.g. allowing for targeted auto insurance products and sales. By putting business and customer data to effective use, the client is able to transform seemingly dormant information into game-changing insights that can help them satisfy their customers, improve their offerings, and boost their bottom-line. Ivan Teh, Fusionex Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \u201cWe are delighted to enter into this long-term partnership with such a valued client, which is in line with our mission of using technology to enable businesses to be more agile, and with greater impact. Fusionex is committed towards helping the client gain an optimum leverage in its field.",

      "description": "Our vision is to incorporate Generic AI into every system that can benefit from generic artificial intelligence capability. The system was initially developed in 1983 as a music composition tool, where the composer manipulates the paths of counterpoint melodies. The development of the system was inspired by Leonard Bernstein's Harvard Lectures on music theory based on Chomskyan linguistics - titled The Unanswered Question. Chomsky said: \u2018He (Bernstein) was onto something, but I couldn't really judge how significant it was...'. Bernstein's analysis of Mozart's 40th in G Minor showed characteristics corresponding to the physical Principle of Least Action and symmetry over scale analogous to gauge invariance in field theory. This analysis formed the starting point from which Generic AI was ultimately developed. By 1989 the core theoretical problem was solved; this took the form of a general-purpose artificial intelligence system. However, it was apparent that it would be at least 20 years before it could be implemented, due to the rate of improvement in computing power. By 2002 parallel processing was close enough to start developing commercial applications taking into account the development time, and so the company: Generic AI Ltd was incorporated. Our objective is to demonstrate the \u2018Artificial General Intelligence' (AGI) properties of the system by creating as many varied applications as possible. Generic AI has these properties: The core Generic AI system always works in the same way for every application It has no pre-programmed rules The data it processes is in a universal format Customised interfaces convert data into this core universal format Patterns and features exist in a kind of 'common currency' between all possible kinds of data input. This enables meaningful data-fusion between disparate data sources.",

We are building a dashboard allowing risk/asset managers and their analysts to obtain the right information edge at the right time. We do so by dynamically processing news, press releases, company filings, investment research or earnings transcripts, and leveraging advanced AI and mathematical methods, some as recent as Fall 2020, including among others non-trivial usage of transformers and topological data analysis. We are motivated by mitigating the risks of another financial crisis due to a lack of timely access to the right economic insights. Indeed, the sanity of the global financial system relies on investors and insurers correctly measuring the inherent risks to their positions, and failure to adequately process the relevant data in time may result in credit defaults or under-performance: an overall lost value for the economy. What adds to the issue is that the amount of unstructured textual data available to the actors of the Finance & Insurance industry has lately grown to an overwhelming degree.

      "description": "We provide a package solution that we refer to as Insight, this consists of innovative multi-parameter sensors, communication module, AI analytics and a web interface. By providing an end-to-end solution we are able to offer a streamlined route for water utilities to innovate whilst rapidly realising the benefits; without needing to piece together the solution themselves. Historically sensors have only measured a few parameters, our Intellisondes accurately measure up to 8 parameters at once. By measuring these parameters, we have managed to use our devices to identify the root cause of discolouration issues, water source mixing, leakage, chemical dosing issues and reservoir ingress, many of which are not possible without the combination of parameters provided by the Intellisonde. Often communications can be overlooked, but providing reliable access to data is key to being able to use that data for decision making. As a result, we created the Intellihub, our communications module, which is able to provide high data availability underground in remote locations, regularly achieving above 95% data availability in some of the most challenging environments. In order to interpret the data and make it useful for decision making, we created our intelligence systems which use bespoke AI algorithms to extract meaningful insights from the data. Our systems can work with 3rd party data or our own sensors, enabling the utilities to get greater value out of their existing assets. The data is visualised through our Insight web-app, this provides intuitive ways to see exactly which parts of the water network need addressing as well as offering tools to enable drilling-down into the root of the problem. Our system automatically processes the data ready for visualisation meaning information on water source mixing, root cause analysis for discolouration, leakage or reservoir ingress are all available instantly through our Insight web-app.",

      "description": "We have developed robots capable of flying autonomously in environments where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is not available. Using our robots, we can provide accurate, high-resolution 3D models and other visualizations to determine the condition of an infrastructure nearly in real-time. This innovative approach is beneficial to carry out inspections of underground, closed or confined areas. This is particularly the case under harsh, dark and dangerous conditions where the inspection process based on current methods entails a major health risk for human operators. Besides the gain in safety our approach boosts the overall efficiency of the process as well as the accuracy of the obtained results. The solution was successfully tested on a global scale in real environments such as underground mines, penstocks in hydroelectric dams, nuclear waste detection and tunnel construction. Further industries have shown significant interest in the technology to carry out inspections. We consider ourselves as a data service company, where the inhouse-developed robot is used as the main tool to gather the data. One of our principles is to keep the highest possible manufacturing range in-house ensuring the control of the supply chain, the delivered quality to the customer as well as the corresponding lead-time.",

Logic-based systems have several advantages over other forms of machine learning, namely: Generalisation: Logic-based systems can generalise from very few examples, making it possible to learn complex knowledge without needing large datasets. Interpretability: As the learned knowledge can be translated into English, it can be explained to users and verified/corrected where necessary. Ability to incorporate existing knowledge: Logic-based systems do not need to learn everything from scratch, and can instead start from an existing knowledge base, containing anything known before the learning starts or even previously learned rules.",

Ten years ago, it was difficult to imagine robots picking delicate berry fruits as well as people. But enormous progress in the field of machine learning and computer vision means that robotic picking is now a reality. Dogtooth is pioneering the use of the most sophisticated robot control systems in applications that previously needed increasingly difficult-to-recruit human labour. But this means more than developing technology in a lab. Since day one, we've been working alongside customers to develop picking solutions capable of use in real farms. Our team of engineering superstars is solving the problem not only of building robot control systems capable of achieving sufficient visual acuity and dexterity, but also of deploying robots into challenging real-world environments, operating robots safely alongside farm personnel, and manufacturing robots at scale. Dogtooth was founded by Dr Duncan Robertson, Ed Herbert and Mat Cook. The business has been funded to date by Innovate UK awards, several angel investors led by Peter Cowley (Chair of Cambridge Angels), Octopus Ventures, the Martlet Fund, and Angel CoFund.",

DSV is focused above all on building the critical infrastructure required for brand new, high growth, high impact companies. In contrast to an accelerator programme, DSV stimulates the generation of novel ideas through our proprietary process that focuses on first-principles thinking. This enables DSV to create companies that represent the \u201choly grail\u201d in that opportunity area. The focus is on \u201ctough\u201d sectors which, relative to their economic value, tend to see fewer startups created. Companies in these sectors tend to draw more investment, create more jobs and move less often. They also tend to be more R&D intensive, and accordingly afford greater positive externalities than companies in other sectors. Visit our website for more information.",

      "description": "Flock was founded on the conviction that insurance was no longer fit for purpose in our fast-moving, hyper-connected world. So we set out to bridge the gap between the insurance industry of today and the emerging technologies of tomorrow. We began in the commercial drone industry, using real-time data (like population density and wind speed) to quantify, insure, and mitigate drone flight risks. We insured thousands of innovative drone operations globally, from agricultural surveyors to NHS medical delivery flights. Our technology helped thousands of pilots around the world to fly safer, reducing their risk exposure by 15% on average. We recently expanded into the rapidly evolving world of connected motor fleets. Modern fleets change on a daily basis; expanding, contracting, and adopting the latest technology. They need an insurance policy that\u2019s as agile and data-driven as they are; so we launched Flock Motor, our connected vehicle division offering insurance designed for the 21st-century fleet. But we\u2019re not done yet. The world is becoming increasingly connected and autonomous, bringing both amazing opportunities and complex risks. As the insurer of the future, Flock will not only pay claims when incidents occur; we\u2019ll help our customers understand and mitigate their own risks, to avoid things going wrong in the first place. We are making the world a safer, smarter place.",

Download the full white paper here. The authors believe that AI could become the most transformative workplace technology of the 21st century, with the associated need for business leaders to assure themselves that they are deploying AI effectively and responsibly. Superhuman Resources sets out a series of practical questions for businesses to address in respect of AI in the areas of governance and quality assurance, in addition to tackling crucial legal considerations. These include privacy and data processing legislation compliance, the potential for discriminatory outputs from AI systems, and the fair allocation of risk. This guidance is set against a regulatory backdrop that poses distinct challenges for policymakers and corporate governance. While the growth of AI is no different from that of other fields of innovation in respect of the need to develop ethics and laws simultaneously, it offers a real opportunity for businesses to shape and influence legal and regulatory frameworks as they begin to adapt to machine-based processes, products and services",

      "description": "Enterprises worldwide spend over $40Bn annually on manually extracting data from documents. This extraordinary sum represents hundreds of millions of human hours spent on tedious, grinding, soul-crushing work which is also slow and prone to errors. The incumbent technology, OCR (optical character recognition) has been around for decades. It\u2019s simplistic, rule-based and performs poorly on many real-life documents. We founded Evolution AI in 2015 to solve that problem. Evolution AI revolutionised data extraction by building a deep-learning machine that closely mimics how humans read documents. Humans not only read characters off the page, we heavily rely on visual cues from graphic design (tables, font types and sizes, colours, bold/italic etc) and of course - on meaning and context. In AI terms, these translate to Visual Reasoning - a branch of computer vision that focuses on how objects visually relate to each other - and NLP (Natural Language Processing), dealing with meaning and semantics. In short, our AI weaves together text, vision and semantics to extract data from documents - just like humans do. Today we process over 1.5M pages per day for our clients. Our unique scientific approach enables us to automatically extract data from any type of document including the most complicated such as quarterly reports, balance sheets, P&L statements, account statements, invoices etc.",

Traditional searching is done with keywords, in combination or proximity; semantic searching is done by expanding to related concepts, which are largely found in similar contexts. In contrast, the key concept behind our technology is very simple. We read the full content of the search document and compare the terms we find with the content of all of the other documents in the dataset. This approach is at the heart of our long-established plagiarism detection programs. The technology can be used for the identification of relevant information in any large document dataset.

The university offers degree courses in a variety of disciplines. Study is available at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, full-time and part-time, and research opportunities are offered. Cardiff Metropolitan University has a number of research and enterprise centres, including the Food Industry Centre, the Welsh Centre for Tourism Research, and the National Centre for Product Design and Development Research.  Under its previous name (the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff, or UWIC), the university had its degrees awarded by the University of Wales. However, UWIC formally ended its association with the University of Wales, and was renamed Cardiff Metropolitan University in November 2011.[4] The university will also now award all of its degrees in its own name.  Despite this 'withdrawal' from the University of Wales, the new Cardiff Metropolitan University retains close formal links with it. Until summer 2012 they shared the same Pro Vice Chancellor of Research, Professor Robert Brown. Cardiff Metropolitan University briefly continued to supply its staff for the University of Wales to use as moderators for their overseas franchised degrees. From 2004 to 2007, Cardiff Metropolitan University's Vice Chancellor, Tony Chapman, was the Senior Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of the University of Wales, whilst also holding the post of Vice Chancellor at UWIC.",

It is the oldest of the four ancient universities of Scotland and the third oldest university in the English-speaking world (following Oxford and Cambridge Universities). St Andrews was founded between 1410 and 1413, when the Avignon Antipope Benedict XIII issued a papal bull to a small founding group of Augustinian clergy. St Andrews is made up of a variety of institutions, comprising three colleges \u2013 United College (a union of St Salvator's and St Leonard's Colleges), St Mary's College, and St Leonard's College, the last named being a non-statutory revival of St Leonard's as a post-graduate society. There are 18 academic schools organised into four faculties.[5] The university occupies historic and modern buildings located throughout the town. The academic year is divided into two terms, Martinmas and Candlemas. In term time, over one-third of the town's population is either a staff member or student of the university.[6] The student body is notably diverse: over 145 nationalities are represented with 45% of its intake from countries outside the UK; about one-eighth of the students are from the rest of the EU and the remaining third are from overseas \u2014 15% from North America alone.[7][8] The university's sport teams compete in BUCS competitions,[9] and the student body is known for preserving ancient traditions such as Raisin Weekend, May Dip, and the wearing of distinctive academic dress.[10] It is ranked as the third best university in the United Kingdom in two of three national league tables, behind Oxbridge.[11][12][13] The Guardian ranks first in the United Kingdom the Schools of Physics and Astronomy, International Relations, Computer Science, Geography, English and Mathematics,[12] whilst The Times and Sunday Times ranks the Schools of English, Management, Philosophy, Anatomy and Physiology and Middle Eastern and African Studies first[14] and the Complete University Guide ranks Management, Divinity and Middle Eastern and African Studies first.[15] The Times Higher Education World Universities Ranking names St Andrews among the world's Top 50 universities for Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities.[16][17] St Andrews consistently holds the highest student satisfaction scores amongst all multi-faculty universities in the United Kingdom.[18] St Andrews has many notable alumni and affiliated faculty, including eminent mathematicians, scientists, theologians, philosophers, and politicians. Recent alumni include the former First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond; former Secretary of State for Defence Michael Fallon; HM British Ambassador to China Barbara Woodward; United States Ambassador to Hungary Colleen Bell; Olympic cycling gold medalist Chris Hoy; and royals Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Six Nobel Laureates are among St Andrews' alumni and former staff: two in Chemistry and Physiology or Medicine, and one each in Peace and Literature.",

      "description": "The University of London is unlike many other universities. It consists of 18 self governing Colleges and 10 smaller specialist research Institutes. In many ways the Colleges are considered universities in their own right; they set their own entrance criteria for their courses and they offer their own services to students. Some now also have their own degree awarding powers. All students from all the Colleges and Institutes are also University of London students, making them part of a community of over 120,000 students and giving them access to many services in London.  Did you know that when making your application through UCAS you can apply to up to five University of London Colleges? They are all considered separate institutions when it comes to applying. Postgraduate students apply directly to the College or Colleges they wish to study with.  Many levels of study are covered at the University of London including foundation, undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, as well as diplomas and research degrees. The Colleges also have a wide range of short courses and summer programmes. Pre-university school students are also able to sample University of London courses and life through the Taster Course programme.  It is not even essential to be in London to study for a University of London degree. We currently have over 54,000 students studying in 180 different countries with the University of London International Programmes.  As well as offering a world-class education the University has a range of other services on offer including a careers service, data archiving and networking, library services, conference facilities and you can even use University buildings for location filming.",

      "description": "The University of West London has one of the best employment rates in the country with 95% of students in work within six months of graduating.   The University of West London draws on a heritage of 150 years in teaching and professional education. First founded as the Lady Byron School in 1860, the institution as it exists today was originally formed from the merger of Ealing College of Higher Education, Thames Valley College of Higher Education, the London College of Music and Queen Charlotte\u2019s College of Health Care Studies.   In 1991, the institution became the Polytechnic of West London, before gaining full university status in 1992 to become Thames Valley University.   The University of West London subsequently evolved through a number of mergers. It merged with Northwick Park School of Nursing, Riverside College of Nursing and the North West Thames Regional Health Authority's AIDS Unit in 1994, Berkshire College of Nursing and Midwifery in 1995, and with Reading College and School of Art and Design in 2004.  In July 2010 the University completed the divestment of its site in King's Road, Reading, (now known as Reading College) and in April 2011 formally changed its name to The University of West London, following prior approval from The Privy Council. The new name reflects a re-focusing of the University's activities on its Ealing and Brentford sites.   In May 2011 the University celebrated the installation of Laurence Geller as its new Chancellor. Laurence is himself an alumnus of the University and a leading figure in the hospitality and tourism sector.   From the outset, the University has played and continues to play a significant role in the educational, cultural and economic life of its region. The University of West London is home to a number of academic schools offering courses in a diverse range of subjects.   At the University of West London they aim to inspire students to become creative professionals and connect them to exciting and rewarding careers. Based in the heart of one of the UK\u2019s most successful business regions, the University has a range of highly quali\ufb01ed staff, with a wealth of experience in their respective disciplines and strong connections with key industries.   The University of West London has a strong reputation for high-quality education closely linked to employment: their graduates go on to achieve great success in their chosen disciplines and professions.",

They combine industry expertise with innovative technology to deliver critical information to leading decision makers in the financial, legal, tax & accounting, scientific, healthcare and media markets, powered by the world's most trusted news organization. RVC, the former venture capital arm of Reuters, was set up in 1994 and began investing RVC I (originally known as The Greenhouse Fund) in Palo Alto, California in 1995. In 1997, RVC expanded the focus of its operations to Europe, bringing its significant Silicon Valley experience to a market with relatively few venture capitalists focused on early stage information technology companies. In September 2001, RVC became independent from Reuters and is now wholly owned by its Investment Partners and Chairman. It was awarded the contract to continue managing RVC I on behalf of Reuters. In establishing its investment independence, RVC has retained its strong relationships with Reuters, its affiliates (Tibco, Factiva, Instinet, Radianz) and its customers, which are primarily financial services and media companies who were amongst the first to be impacted by and adopt new technology. Building on RVC\u2019s relationship with Reuters in financial services, RVC is developing similar relationships with leading corporations in other verticals, and acquiring deeper understanding of the needs and challenges CIOs and business decision makers have in increasing efficiency and/or revenues through their leverage of IT investments. In early 2004, after 10 years of successful technology investments, Reuters announced a strategy of refocusing on its core activities and away from venture technology investments. Over the ensuing few months, the partners at RVC explored the opportunity of buying RGF and successfully obtained debt financing for the purchase. On 22 June 2004, Norman Fiore, Martin Stapleton and John Taysom along with Chairman Sir David Walker became the new owners of RGF via their new vehicle Sofius Capital. RVC will remain the manager of the RGF and will continue to invest in RGF portfolio companies to maximise the overall return on the committed capital of the fund. Since inception, RVC I has invested \u20ac449 million in 82 companies, including Yahoo!, Verisign, Phone.com (now Openwave Systems), Digimarc, Infoseek, Orchestream, and Metamerge, amongst others. With 16 IPOs and 27 trade sales or other cash realisations, and a first fund that is 94% returned, they believe they have one of the strongest track records in Europe. Today, RVC has 11 staff located in London and the Silicon Valley.",

Since selling his previous company and moving to Bristol from London in 2005 Mike has looked at many different investment opportunities. With a strong tech background having built and run web sites for Microsoft since 1994, Mike saw that investing in a single app or web service can be very high risk. Reading an article about the original Silicon Valley Internet Incubator, Y-Combinator, in 2011 convinced him that this was the safest route for investing. He then found that existing UK based incubators were mainly in London and required investment through a funding vehicle, not directly into the startups themselves, making it difficult for investors to benefit from the all important SEIS tax relief. With the establishment of the Engine Shed, Mike saw that Bristol now had the perfect venue for an internet incubator and after assembling a team of top Bristol based mentors and business advisors, Webstart Bristol was born.",
