# Accessibility

Ensuring greater access to technologies by meeting the needs of people with
disabilities lays the foundation for inclusive work cultures that empower
individuals and teams to thrive.

Therefore, {toolName} is committed to making its best effort towards continually
improving the accessibility of all the information provided in this website.

## Support

We follow the recommendations of the [WCAG 2.1 guidelines]({wcag21Url}). Also:
	* Ensure that the choices of color provide sufficient contrast for
	  comfortable reading.
	* Offer a selection of typefaces for improved legibility, including one
	  widely believed to improve comprehension among people with
	  [Dyslexia]({openDyslexicUrl}).
	* Wherever it's possible, enhance the semantic meta information of each page
	  to improve the reach of tools such as screen readers.
	* We regularly measure our site using a variety of methods, such as
	  third-party automated and manual audits across a range of different
	  browsers and devices. You can review some of those results in the
	  "Quality audits" section below.

## WCAG compliance rating

According to automated testing using the 
[Pa11y accessibility testing tool]({pa11yUrl}), no accessibility issues were
detected and this website is reported to have a WCAG 2.0 AAA compliance level.
This website also passes the accessibility audits checked by 
[Google's Lighthouse tool]({lighthouseUrl}).

## Limitations

Although we continually revise the website for proper support, we recognize that
some pages may present occasional accessibility problems. Also, just as
technology improves and standards evolve, our work is also never done and we
continually strive to achieve the highest levels of compliance with the
requirements and recommendations.

Meeting all of the WCAG criteria requires evaluating some of them manually. Due
to time constraints we might not have been able to test all of the
recommendations listed in the section "Additional items to manually check" in
the "Accessibility" part of each audit below, in the "Quality audits" section of
this page. In particular at this time ARIA and keyboard navigation are only
partially supported.

While we aim to make the information provided as accessible as possible, this
website presents data mostly as interactive charts which at the moment do not
also render a text alternative, so those aren't accessible by screen readers.
However, the data is available for [download in CSV format]({zipUrl}).

## Feedback

If you see any errors or have other suggestions on how we can further improve
the accessibility of our site, please contact us at

## Resources

### Using a screen reader

If you need a screen reader and have not installed one already, you may choose
one from this [comprehensive list of screen readers]({screenReadersUrl}).

### How to customize the mouse pointer

You can customize a computer mouse pointer in several ways. For example, you can
slow down the speed of the mouse pointer for easier handling. You can also
change its appearance so that it contrasts more with the screen content.
