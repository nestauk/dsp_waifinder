		"description": "Measure pulse rate and breathing rate totally contact free, be alerted to risky activities (for example a dementia patient getting out of bed) and review objective data on activity and vital signs to inform care planning. Oxehealth gives clinicians, carers and custodians more time for hands on care. We are the first company in the world to certify software as a medical device which enables a secure optical sensor to measure vital signs from right across a room. Our Digital Care Assistant is paying attention to every room when you can't be there. This Software as a Service solution generates the alerts and reports clinicians, carers and custodians need, seamlessly slotted into their existing workflow. The Digital Care Assistant is helping hundreds of staff in mental health, police, care home, prison, acute hospital and home care settings. A spin out from Oxford University's Department of Engineering, Oxehealth's technology can measure pulse & breathing rate and human activity & behaviour using proprietary algorithms which harness deep learning, computer vision and signal processing techniques.",
