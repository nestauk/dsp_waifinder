Resurrecting Lost Art with AI. Visit us at Deeep - https://www.deeep.digital/ - London's First AI Art Fair from 13th - 17th October 2021. Gallery: www.oxia-palus.com Contact: enquiries@oxia-palus.com Our work combines the technologies of spectroscopic imaging, artificial intelligence, and 3D printing to recreate lost artwork. Our vision is to bring to life an artist parallel universe. With potentially thousands of works of art hidden dormant beneath existing paintings the journey in resurrecting the world's lost art has only just begun. In September 2019 Oxia Palus featured in MIT Technology Review for reconstructing La Femme Perdue and subsequently gained worldwide press coverage. Since then Oxia Palus has presented research at NeurIPS 2019, came 3rd in NVIDIA's Top 10 AI Developer Stories of 2019 and recently featured in NVIDIA's GTC 2020 Keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. In May 2020 Oxia Palus joined NVIDIA's Inception Program. In October 2020 we featured in NVIDIA's GTC Inaugural AI Art Gallery to unveil Madonna, a lost Leonardo da Vinci, hidden beneath da Vinci's Virgin of the Rocks. In December 2020 we partnered with MORF Gallery, a futuristic online gallery showcasing limited edition fine art. In 2021 Oxia Palus joined Conception X. In April 2021, Oxia Palus and MORF Gallery unveiled and sold The World's First NeoMaster - Parc del Laberint d'Horta - a lost masterpiece resurrected on canvas using spectroscopy, artificial intelligence and 3D printing paired with an NFT. In June 2021 Oxia Palus won CogX's Best Innovation in Creative Arts 2021 and showcased World's First NeoMaster Exhibition at the Lebenson Gallery in London. We plan to showcase new work at London's first AI dedicated art fair, Deeep, from 13 - 17th October 2021.

Utilizing an intelligent Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV), Perceptual Robotics provides existing inspection engineers with a new, cost effective inspection tool that increases number of inspections, and quality, whilst minimising health and safety risks. Dhalion is an autonomous inspection platform for wind turbines. At the press of a button Dhalion allows existing O&M teams to complete wind turbine inspections in minutes rather hours with increased inspection quality. The path is optimised for optimum coverage, reliability in weather and consistent data acquisiton. Throughout the flight Dhalion minds its surrounding and deals intelligently with obstacles and unexpected situations. The inspection data are then automatically distilled to useful information about position, size and severity of defects on the tower and blades. It can identify lightning strikes, cracks, erosion and delamination as well as highlight anything out of the ordinary.

For example, colon cancers that have a normally functioning version of a surface protein called KRAS are likely to respond to certain anti-EGFR antibody therapies; those in which the protein is absent or non-fun. Successful innovation in precision medicine requires several sectors (academia, healthcare and industry) work together - often easier said than done. P4 sits at the intersection of these sectors, leveraging our academic, industry and healthcare connections to create a healthtech ecosystem to supercharge the development and scale of precision medicine technologies. Our flagship \"accelerator\" programme is the first of its kind in the UK, and is a partnership with UCL and Barclays. The first cohort in the accelerator are nearly half-way through the 12 month programme. So far, the accelerator has supported these 11 companies to raise £30million, receive 9 research grants and hire 7 new employees. The accelerator provides start-ups with personalized connections and introductions, as well as other support including workshops, personalised coaching (grant writing, AI and IP/regulations), testbeds and trial opportunities and regulatory pathway support to CE marking.

Here at Personify XP, we have a passion for making everyone's digital experiences personal. Josh and Ben started Personify XP because we recognized that 95% of people who visit a website are anonymous and receive a generic experience. That's just not good enough. That's not because companies haven't recognised how important these visitors are - it's just that there has been no great way to do it. For so long companies have focused on 'knowing the customer' before they can personalise to them. With GDPR and people becoming much more cautious over sharing data it has become harder to personalise to website visitors as companies know less about their visitors. Even when there is a lot of data available on customers it still takes considerable time within a company to segment their visitors and then manually create the user journeys for each of these segments. Personalisation takes a lot of time and a lot of decisioning - why couldn't all of this be automated? The Personify Anonymous Experience platform is the first platform to focus exclusively on anonymous visitors. Our AI platform connects great products with shoppers you know nothing about through automating how content and products are shown to which shoppers and when.

The band has an LED system that lights up to count the number of times that's happened. We've taught Nudge to recognise over 1,000 hand and arm gestures, so it should always know where your hand is in relation to your face and head. And as smart as Nudge is, we love the fact that it works straight out of the box, no need to calibrate it or hook it up to an app. As soon as nudge arrives, it can be charged up, and users pop it straight on their wrist to start their training sessions.","id":"ac65cf1be1ccec096f311a50f1caa8f679a91493","location":{"lat":51.527304,"lon":-0.088894,"postcode":"EC1V2NX"},"name":"Nudge","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Excoriation_disorder","Artificial_intelligence","Gesture_recognition","Trichotillomania","Fish_hook","Pop_music","Nudge_(book)"],"topics":[{"id":"Excoriation_disorder","score":100},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":90},{"id":"Gesture_recognition","score":90},{"id":"Trichotillomania","score":90},{"id":"Fish_hook","score":80},{"id":"Pop_music","score":70},{"id":"Nudge_(book)","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.nudgeband.co.uk"},{"description":"Perseptive is a London-based digital healthcare SME developing high-impact AI-solutions utilising cutting edge 2D/3D computer-vision and digital sound processing for remote monitoring, diagnosis and management of age-related diseases and movement disorders.

As you start to consider that digital transformation, here are 5 reasons why you should consider QiO as part of that plan- because buzzwords alone aren't going to solve your problems. 1. QiO empowers clients to drive value-based innovation by removing the burdens of legacy software vendor requirements, dependency and thinking. Steadfast in our commitment to the success of our clients, QiO does not lock companies into perpetual software licenses, embed immovable consulting teams, or monetise our client's customer database. Simply, our clients own their data, customers, and innovation... the way it should be. See our Chairman Rick Haythornthwaite expand on these ideas in a recent interview with SkyNews. QiO Foresight IIoT Platform is built from the ground up by industrial engineers for industrial engineers to dramatically improve operational efficiency, productivity, and safety. Applications are infused with artificial intelligence, provide smart automated workflows for team collaboration and scale across your production and supply chain. Ingredients matter. QiO Foresight IIoT enables industrial and manufacturing teams to problem-solve, experiment and redefine production assumptions in real-time. The platform is built to securely accommodate any data, any asset, any source, at any scale, and on any cloud - edge, private, hybrid or public. Your problems don't live in silos, your applications shouldn't either. See how Rolls-Royce is using QiO to improve their outcomes. 4. QiO is the only company providing industrial engineers with a self-learning digital twin, PARCS Profile, that is not limited by static slices of point-in-time views and becomes smarter with each deployed Foresight Suite application. The profile uses design, manufacturing and operations data to create a single lexicon defined by five real-world factors - Performance, Availability, Reliability, Capacity and Serviceability. To further secure data and provide traceability across the supply chain, each profile is encapsulated with a unique blockchain key. Fast-track your digital program. 5. Digital progress usually requires a shift in organisational inertia to foster an Industry 4.0 culture. Having an experienced industrial partner who can aid in framing ambitions, navigating challenges and providing purpose-built tools is a must have on this journey. No more time and money wasted to procure and install compute, network and storage infrastructure or manage resource-intensive vendor contracts. It's time to demand more. These are just a few of the numerous reasons why you should make QiO your partner for your digital transformation. If you'd like to get started on your digital transformation journey try Foresight Performance risk-free.","id":"b4b300459d4e4bd91b73ef51a683617214d7f564","location":{"lat":51.295958,"lon":-0.752502,"postcode":"GU147NA"},"name":"QiO Technologies","name_extra":"","place_id":"4fe91a97f07f8c45b88dadf7e93f6cdf4d290ff3","topicIds":["Fourth_Industrial_Revolution","Artificial_intelligence","Blockchain","Cloud_computing","Richard_Haythornthwaite","Rolls-Royce_Holdings","Lock_and_key","Onslaught_(comics)","Digital_twin","Sky_News","Strategic_foresight","Database","Inertia","Supply_chain"],"topics":[{"id":"Fourth_Industrial_Revolution","score":100},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":90},{"id":"Blockchain","score":90},{"id":"Cloud_computing","score":90},{"id":"Richard_Haythornthwaite","score":90},{"id":"Rolls-Royce_Holdings","score":90},{"id":"Lock_and_key","score":80},{"id":"Onslaught_(comics)","score":80},{"id":"Digital_twin","score":70},{"id":"Sky_News","score":70},{"id":"Strategic_foresight","score":70},{"id":"Database","score":60},{"id":"Inertia","score":60},{"id":"Supply_chain","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://qio.ai"},{"description":"Optix Risk Management software is a dynamic Security Risk Management System that delivers Risk Assurance for Senior Executives and operational security risks.

Successfully piloted at Europe's biggest Hospital, the Qubit Pathway Management platform provides an effective integrated tool for elective care management, that has provided significant improvements in terms of performance, efficiency, safety and user experience. Through partnership with both clinical and non-clinical NHS staff the Qubit Pathway Management system has been developed with NHS staff priorities at the core of its design. By combining effective management tools with pathway visualisation and reporting, it provides a holistic and intuitive approach to managing complex waiting list challenges. Working in partnership with our NHS colleagues is fundamental to everything we do; by adopting an agile approach to product development we are able to listen to their needs and adapt the platform to meet changing requirements through rapid deployments of new functionality. During the Covid-19 pandemic we have added new sector-wide ptl functionality to help providers identify and share capacity across a sector, coordinate clinical prioritisation and model sector demand and capacity. Our Vision: To improve patient outcomes through intelligent software and smart data Our Mission: To innovate powerful software solutions that improve and optimise patient pathway management Core solutions: Patient pathway and data quality management software solution Our approach: We believe in the NHS and want to ensure that our healthcare partners have the best possible tools to meet the ever increasing health challenges of the UK. Our goal is to provide them with powerful, intuitive software solutions that support safe and equitable care, whilst also improving efficiency and integration of services by harnessing the potential of cutting edge machine learning technologies.","id":"f5929c43f631644f7937cd486ad9a9db4f2d926f","location":{"lat":51.390642,"lon":-0.274417,"postcode":"KT59HT"},"name":"Qubit Health","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Machine_learning","NHS_England","Pandemic","Quality_management"],"topics":[{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90},{"id":"NHS_England","score":80},{"id":"Pandemic","score":60},{"id":"Quality_management","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.qubithealth.com"},{"description":"A fashion e-commerce platform powered by machine learning and personality science.

The data they had to deal with came from the Planck satellite and went from the present day to the Big Bang, spanning ten billion years. The tool, PolyChord, successfully extracted the desired information from that data - and we now look to apply it to commercial instances where there are similar Big Data problems with issues of high dimensionality, many variables, complexity, and dirtiness. Many people these days claim to have smart data tools - PolyChord is a genuine step change ahead of the rest and can fit models to data when the task is exceptionally challenging, in order to extract information and make predictions. We have made progress by collaborating with large, dynamic successful companies, who have gathered data, prepared it for analysis, but have then run into difficulties with the number of variables, and high dimensionality. Fitting traditional models to extract this information is then impossible - this is where our PolyChord tool really delivers, and global optimisation is also achievable in many circumstances. PolyChord has this year been used to optimise neural networks, where we treat the honeycomb-like surface of the neural network as a high dimensional data problem in its own right and solve it using PolyChord. The result is PolyNet, a second tool for the company, and a new way of using neural networks for more accurate Machine Learning.

One brain trying to tell 100,000 hands just doesn't work. Founded by two McKinsey alums in 2016, Quorso's AI was created to unlock human ingenuity. Frontline teams at multi-site businesses run more than half of the global economy. They are a powerful group with the experience, expertise, and heart to make their businesses successful. But all too often, these managers work as cogs in an engine, with limited visibility into their business and not a ton of flexibility to make decisions.

Imagine yourself as a guest in a very crowded event. There are many photographers present, they are all running around and taking photos of everyone. You pose - the flash goes off, and you just walk away. It is very likely that you will never see that photo of you. If you are at a wedding, and if the bride/groom is a close friend of yours maybe they will send you a few photos eventually. The photographer approaches you, shows a single photo that he has printed of yours. It is not a flattering photo, but you will purchase it anyways, because you want a memory of this night. You will try to take a photo of the photo to share on Instagram, but the photo will look either blurry or the flash will go off making the whole thing impossible. The night is young. You have a pocket or a tiny clutch and a photo that doesn't fit into it. By the time you get home tonight, there will be many drink stains on that photo. You are also very likely to lose it, or to end up with someone else's photo. We at Photier hate this scenario. We think photos should be viewed instantly. And that is what we do. We make sure that we simplify all the steps in between the click, and you receiving the photo. The face recognition system takes a minute to recognise your face in the pool of thousands of people. We can recognise you from the smallest detail on your face. We send you the photo and that's it. The photo doesn't come with extra baggage. You can store it, stare at it, or post it - it's all up to you. Photier can be used in all kinds of events where a DSLR camera is being used. This may be at a wedding or a graduation, a ski resort or a private baby shower to name a few. As long as there are photos that need to go to their owners we can help. We like to think that the sky is the limit, and we work very hard to make that true.","id":"61783ccadba3a10c0416fff7a8866e01dbcab76f","location":{"lat":51.498446,"lon":-0.208023,"postcode":"W148BB"},"name":"Photier","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera","Imagine_Software","Instagram","Artificial_intelligence","Ski_resort","Facial_recognition_system","Mobile_app","Baby_shower","Bride"],"topics":[{"id":"Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera","score":90},{"id":"Imagine_Software","score":90},{"id":"Instagram","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Ski_resort","score":80},{"id":"Facial_recognition_system","score":70},{"id":"Mobile_app","score":70},{"id":"Baby_shower","score":60},{"id":"Bride","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://photier.com"},{"description":"RADAR launched in 2018 as a revolutionary news agency using automation and AI to empower journalists and inform citizens.

It's also an emotional microscope. We created Phebi so quantitative and qualitative researchers could better understand what's in people's heads and hearts. Simple, affordable, and quick-to-deploy, Phebi empowers researchers to collect and analyze what people say, gain insights they can't get any other way, and better predict behavior. Phebi's award-winning software has two main parts: - A plugin that makes it easy to voice-enable any survey and improve the user experience. And, when people talk instead of type they say more, especially on mobile. - A portal that makes it easy to explore, analyze and visualize what people have said (transcription), how they said it (sentiment analysis), and how they felt about what they said (emotion analysis). It also makes it easy to tell the story in the data. Phebi provides emotion and sentiment scores to quantify the qualitative at scale. It enables researchers to use AI-generated tags and apply their own to identify and dig into subgroups and topics. And, Phebi identifies where peak emotion is expressed and facilitates downloading audio clips. In addition to data collected via the plugin, Phebi supports data collection via phone surveys and does analysis of long-form audio captured at call centers and through qualitative work like focus groups and IDIs.

We understand that shareholders and the public are becoming increasingly intolerant of project failure, particularly when it is often foreseeable and avoidable. We exploit the very latest techniques in AI and machine learning to leverage the knowledge and insights from a vast array of interconnected project data; identifying and joining dots in a way that until recently would have been unimaginable. This has the potential to transform how organisations develop their project delivery capability and in our opinion will deliver the most significant change to project delivery in a generation. Projecting Success are helping to shape the thinking on what is an incredibly complex but hugely exciting emergent capability. We use the insights from connected data to provide early warnings, suggested courses of action, interventions, checklists and contextualised feedback to help project delivery experts navigate their way dynamic and rapidly evolving project environments. Examples include extracting real time insights from market and contract data, integrating this with tender documentation and aligning the rich seam of bid data that exists within organisations. We also provide tailored insights on the profitability and delivery challenges from previous projects and use the insights from this experience to shape future bids; an intelligent and adaptive bid management capability. The capability then extends into intelligent scheduling, using deep learning to identify correlations in performance across each element of the work breakdown structure, across thousands of projects. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. Our capabilities are truly revolutionary.","id":"7eb70af3a46dffd9c73f1c7e9f5e2e8bba378ce3","location":{"lat":51.086023,"lon":-1.666848,"postcode":"SP51RH"},"name":"Projecting Success","name_extra":"","place_id":"2d158a4589a38a6b27fe4a81cd0f8c5259176c22","topicIds":["Deep_learning","Work_breakdown_structure","Iceberg","Machine_learning","Artificial_intelligence","Project_management"],"topics":[{"id":"Deep_learning","score":100},{"id":"Work_breakdown_structure","score":100},{"id":"Iceberg","score":90},{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Project_management","score":80}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://projectingsuccess.co.uk"},{"description":"At Pixpro, we develop cutting-edge software solutions based on photogrammetry and computer vision to facilitate the daily work in mining, mapping, inspection, architecture, geodesy and other industries.

LPA was founded in 1980 and is widely known for its range of Prolog compilers and more recently for VisiRule. LPA was established to exploit research at Imperial College, London into logic programming carried out under the supervision of Prof Robert Kowalski. One of the first implementations made available by LPA was micro-PROLOG which ran on popular 8-bit home computers such as the Sinclair Spectrum and Apple II. This was followed by micro-PROLOG Professional one of the first Prolog implementations for MS-DOS. As well as continue with Prolog compiler technology development, LPA has a track record of creating innovative associated tools and products to address specific challenges and opportunities. In 1989, LPA developed the Flex expert system toolkit, which incorporated frame-based reasoning with inheritance, rule-based programming and data-driven procedures. Flex has its own English-like Knowledge Specification Language (KSL) which means that knowledge and rules are defined in an easy-to-read and understand way. In 1992, LPA helped set up the Prolog Vendors Group, a not-for-profit organization whose aim was to help promote Prolog by making people aware of its usage in industry. In 2000, LPA helped set up Business Integrity, now a leading supplier of document assembly and contract creation software solutions for the legal market. LPA's core product is LPA Prolog for Windows, a compiler and development system for the Microsoft Windows platform. The current LPA software range comprises an integrated AI toolset which covers various aspects of Artificial Intelligence including Logic Programming, Expert Systems, Knowledge-based Systems, Data Mining, Agents and Case-based reasoning etc. In 2004, LPA launched VisiRule a graphical tool for developing knowledge-based and decision support systems. VisiRule has been used in various sectors, to build legal expert systems, machine diagnostic programs, medical and financial advice systems, etc.","id":"d2b9bc8d62e6b3e556d138742c7f628f4bdfb86d","location":{"lat":51.509117,"lon":-0.194937,"postcode":"W84AT"},"name":"Logic Programming Associates","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Case-based_reasoning","Expert_system","Legal_expert_system","Logic_Programming_Associates","Logic_programming","MS-DOS","Robert_Kowalski","ZX_Spectrum","Apple_II","Artificial_intelligence","Imperial_College_London","Microsoft_Windows","Prolog","Comparison_of_Prolog_implementations","8-bit_computing","Apache_Flex","Data_mining","KSL-TV"],"topics":[{"id":"Case-based_reasoning","score":100},{"id":"Expert_system","score":100},{"id":"Legal_expert_system","score":100},{"id":"Logic_Programming_Associates","score":100},{"id":"Logic_programming","score":100},{"id":"MS-DOS","score":100},{"id":"Robert_Kowalski","score":100},{"id":"ZX_Spectrum","score":100},{"id":"Apple_II","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":90},{"id":"Imperial_College_London","score":90},{"id":"Microsoft_Windows","score":90},{"id":"Prolog","score":90},{"id":"Comparison_of_Prolog_implementations","score":80},{"id":"8-bit_computing","score":70},{"id":"Apache_Flex","score":60},{"id":"Data_mining","score":60},{"id":"KSL-TV","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.lpa.co.uk"},{"description":"An information company using machine learning and IoT to unlock hidden insights into productivity and safety of a construction workforce.","id":"747708391aa7142e988962359f141e0666de3f1e","location":{"lat":51.240262,"lon":-0.612113,"postcode":"GU27YG"},"name":"Mafic","name_extra":"","place_id":"54ce9cf10e68958a9674dddd6c92ee2a67c59483","topicIds":["Machine_learning","Internet_of_things"],"topics":[{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90},{"id":"Internet_of_things","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://mafic.ltd"},{"description":"Kami is an AI conversational platform which powers businesses with smart robot advisory services","id":"089981e9152b9091991b89a04e90ddb18a05a26f","location":{"lat":51.504937,"lon":-0.019523,"postcode":"E145AB"},"name":"Kami","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Robot","Artificial_intelligence","Kami"],"topics":[{"id":"Robot","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Kami","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://kami.ai/"},{"description":"Artificial Intelligence of Things","id":"d210494afa2da93b5657c7becb26e5f36d7a4032","location":{"lat":51.732993,"lon":-1.20884,"postcode":"OX42LG"},"name":"Magna Technologies Ltd","name_extra":"","place_id":"9723dc1f8345614ec4eb1f19218a4bedd2a02774","topicIds":["Artificial_intelligence"],"topics":[{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://www.magna-technology.com"},{"description":"Manufactory is building artificial intelligence and blockchain driven factories that can think for themselves.","id":"791a3595d5914a3507e50e70cf495718c09521cb","location":{"lat":51.88645,"lon":-2.080562,"postcode":"GL530AX"},"name":"Manufactory","name_extra":"","place_id":"1e038930ee3e2ca0e7e5003194b10a164ac30c5b","topicIds":["Artificial_intelligence","Blockchain"],"topics":[{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":90},{"id":"Blockchain","score":90}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://manufactory.ai"},{"description":"Prodonnees Ltd is a dynamic data analysis company.

Employers use complex applicant tracking systems to search for keywords in CVs and match them against the job description. The closer the match, the more likely someone is to get an interview. Or, to put it another way, if the CV doesn't contain the words the applicant tracking system is looking for, the chances of being selected are very low indeed. JobRocket has analysed hundreds of thousands of job ads, CVs and applicant tracking systems to develop a unique algorithm that helps candidates improve their job match score instantly. Once job seekers upload their CV and apply for jobs on the JobRocket website (JobRocket is linked to major recruitment websites and has access to tens of thousands of jobs), the machine learning algorithm instantly evaluates key elements in the CV against the position advertised. It then generates a match score and constructive feedback on how to tailor the CV to get through the employers' Applicant Tracking Systems and rank highly in recruiter searches.","id":"2f408a47ee6643a8ffdacb86d2f25f27cf7d5900","location":{"lat":51.514897,"lon":-0.123615,"postcode":"WC2H9JQ"},"name":"JobRocket","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Applicant_tracking_system","Machine_learning","The_Closer","Algorithm","Artificial_intelligence"],"topics":[{"id":"Applicant_tracking_system","score":100},{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90},{"id":"The_Closer","score":90},{"id":"Algorithm","score":80},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://jobrocket.co.uk"},{"description":"Jumping Rivers specializes in data analytics, machine learning, data science, big data, data mining, training, and consulting.","id":"291ccb59a333baa39b97b0a4cad10464df4d836a","location":{"lat":54.973003,"lon":-1.624295,"postcode":"NE45TG"},"name":"Jumping Rivers","name_extra":"","place_id":"aaa8db814aba407fb015339465a996dfe2cdb4a6","topicIds":["Data_mining","Machine_learning","Big_data","Data_science"],"topics":[{"id":"Data_mining","score":100},{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90},{"id":"Big_data","score":80},{"id":"Data_science","score":70}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://www.jumpingrivers.com"},{"description":"In LIBRA AI technologies, we help small & medium enterprises enjoy disruptive AI technologies and advanced business intelligence, leading to tangible business benefits without requiring in-house data scientists and engineers.

With immediate, fully objective and in-depth results, teachers can then work with our dedicated intervention package to support both emerging and fluent readers in their development. Following 30 years of academic research at the Karolinska Institute, which has selected the Nobel laureates in Physiology and Medicine since 1901, we first launched our unique method of measuring reading attainment in Sweden in 2015. After a successful entrance into the US in 2017, we then launched in the UK early in 2018. Our work across the globe is still driven by the same overarching commitment to education and literacy upon which Lexplore was founded many years ago. Literacy skills are fundamental to so much of school life and beyond, yet in the UK almost 148,000 children still leave primary school unable to read well. Our mission from the start was to provide teachers with the technology, resources and information needed to identify those struggling readers early and raise attainment for all pupils. Since 2015, our assessment has undergone much further development. Today, having conducted more than 200,000 tests across the UK, US, Sweden and internationally, we have featured heavily in the press, including on BBC News, been nominated for BETT, E-Assessment and ERA awards, and have been ranked 8th in Europe's top 50 most innovative companies! We are also extremely proud that our assessment and interventions are helping to the bridge the literacy gap globally!

The AlphaGo AI was remarkable because it was not taught how to play Go, it was taught how to learn to play Go. In game two of the five match series AlphaGo played a move that not only would no human have played, but one which the experts could not initially understand and thought was a mistake. This pivotal move led to AlphaGo winning the game and it went on to win the series 4-1 That move was Move 37. Move 37 showed that with correct application of emerging technology, we can find new approaches to problems, rethink ways of operating and ultimately find new ways to win.","id":"be99f3d6c1a70ab1f7f6bb5cc3d836943988dac6","location":{"lat":51.516376,"lon":-0.081206,"postcode":"EC2N4AY"},"name":"MV37","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["AlphaGo","DeepMind","Lee_Sedol","PlayStation_Move","Algorithm","Artificial_intelligence","Go_(game)","Remarkable_(tablet)"],"topics":[{"id":"AlphaGo","score":100},{"id":"DeepMind","score":100},{"id":"Lee_Sedol","score":100},{"id":"PlayStation_Move","score":90},{"id":"Algorithm","score":80},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Go_(game)","score":60},{"id":"Remarkable_(tablet)","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://mv37.io"},{"description":"Macrina Investment Management (MIM) was formed to capitalise on the considerable opportunities presented by the rapid developments we are currently seeing in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics and other 'deep technologies'.

From the types of cameras required, the ideal positioning of those cameras and how the software can be set up to maximise the return on the investment. Face detection is generally a term used for cameras and digital recording devices to pick out the characteristics of the human face and then put a coloured box around it. This is often then used as a trigger or an alarm of some sort to activate the system or bring to the operators attention that a face / person has been detected. Often these systems can only work on a small number of faces at a time with one frame of video. This is also the technology employed in mobile phones and gaming consoles. Face recognition is now common place in many domestic applications, in laptops it is used to to recognise the person logging in and to perform the login automatically, smart TV's utilise the technology to provide the viewer with a preferred channel listing. Track-a-face is a professional surveillance tool for government, town centre surveillance, shopping malls and other high footfall areas. The major difference between track-a-face products and its domestic relatives, is its processing speed. The software is developed over many years by Herta in Spain and is capable of processing 40 or more faces in a continuous video feed. It will detect ALL the faces, analyse ALL the faces and compare them with its database of known people. If it finds a match it will then trigger an alarm and bring up a picture of the detected person the picture from the saved database and the details of the person that are held on file. Providing the cameras are set correctly, the system has been shown to be more than 95% accurate.","id":"917832d0b8faced7b8f2937c629b7544e5dbf50b","location":{"lat":51.587229,"lon":-0.201446,"postcode":"NW110AH"},"name":"Track A Face","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Face_detection","Smart_TV","Spain","Facial_recognition_system","Database","Digital_audio"],"topics":[{"id":"Face_detection","score":100},{"id":"Smart_TV","score":100},{"id":"Spain","score":80},{"id":"Facial_recognition_system","score":70},{"id":"Database","score":60},{"id":"Digital_audio","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://trackaface.co.uk"},{"description":"Moleculomics is a life science technology company focused on genome scale in silico modelling of protein structure, ligand docking and protein-protein interactions, serving the pharmaceutical, health and biotech sectors.

Over the past 3 years we've evolved from home-made smart socket prototypes and basic software into the market-ready certified \"m.e Platform\" with integral Machine Learning. It's the ultimate building control, automation and management system to eliminate waste. The m.e Platform focuses on Small Power, sometimes known as Plug Load power, which can account for up to 40% of a commercial buildings' energy consumption. No system in any building can measure, control or automate Small Power in any useful way. Did you know that between 25% to 50% of Small Power can be classified as wasted energy and GHG emissions? This wastage comes from occupant devices left switched-on or in standby to large water heaters and devices being-on overnight for no reason. For any organisation wishing to be 'net-zero' Small Power waste must be addressed. The m.e Platform is designed to simply fit into this infrastructure and management gap, automatically identifying Small Power wasted energy and controlling it, reducing total energy costs and GHG emissions by up to 50%. Unlike others' efforts to fill the gap, we've created a hardware and software system that's accurate, safe and effective. Our self-designed m.e Power Socket is a like for like replacement for any normal power socket or fused spur, is low cost and lasts for at least 10 years. Our Software is cloud based and features our own Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to identify what's plugged-in, what state the device is in, and whether or not its wasted energy. We can eliminate wasted energy loads by simply switching-off, using it for Demand Side Response (DSR), or targeting use to maximise carbon/cost efficiency.","id":"a3e35ff3099447290369d785709d184b90bb92fb","location":{"lat":51.454364,"lon":-0.976367,"postcode":"RG17QF"},"name":"measurable.energy","name_extra":"","place_id":"d48b3eeaaae26e43396d225510ecc1f4aa79fb90","topicIds":["Building_code","Cloud_computing","Global_warming_potential","Greenhouse_gas_emissions","Automation","Integral","Machine_learning"],"topics":[{"id":"Building_code","score":90},{"id":"Cloud_computing","score":90},{"id":"Global_warming_potential","score":90},{"id":"Greenhouse_gas_emissions","score":90},{"id":"Automation","score":80},{"id":"Integral","score":80},{"id":"Machine_learning","score":70}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://measurable.energy"},{"description":"We're making remote health & wellness assessments more accessible to everyone.

For advertisers, the success or failure of TV campaigns was based on out-of-date, inaccurate information. TV ads were always bought and designed around ratings data - received about six weeks after a spot aired. Advertisers had no way of knowing crucial details about what spot worked best, on what network, on what day, during what time of day, etc. For a $202 billion global industry, TV advertising had no accurate way of measuring and optimizing TV. Our team of data scientists, many who spent most of their careers in fintech and e-commerce, found out about the lack of timely data analysis for TV advertising and set out to solve that problem by turning TV into an optimizable marketing channel. Today, more than 600 brands, agencies and networks in 60+ countries use TVSquared. Whether it's determining the effectiveness of a single spot, improving the performance of on-air campaigns, optimizing media spend, informing planning and buying or understanding the total impact of TV, TVSquared has succeeded in making it all possible.","id":"5f365f5089916bbeedda8d8613f5a8f8238aeabc","location":{"lat":55.947267,"lon":-3.208791,"postcode":"EH38UL"},"name":"TVSquared","name_extra":"","place_id":"bc29cdd7a36d0fa91590c995e9a8d9a00719bb65","topicIds":["Edinburgh","E-commerce","Marketing_channel","Startup_company","Television_ratings_in_Australia"],"topics":[{"id":"Edinburgh","score":90},{"id":"E-commerce","score":70},{"id":"Marketing_channel","score":60},{"id":"Startup_company","score":60},{"id":"Television_ratings_in_Australia","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://www.tvsquared.com/"},{"description":"Accelerating change to net-zero materials Materials Nexus is a high-tech start-up that originated at Cambridge University and within the Carbon13 Venture Builder.

The problem with contract negotiation is that it is slow and inefficient, and therefore expensive. Each individual lawyer can waste hundreds of hours per year reading every word in every contract when most of the language is common and represents little or no risk. Once a lawyer has read the contract and understood the key issues, managing those issues to resolution is manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. Creating an issue list each time is difficult, time-consuming, and hard to maintain, so keeping stakeholders informed and collaborating on issues with colleagues is handled via email and phone calls. As a result, negotiations often descend into 'redlining battles' and interminable iterations of back and forth. The key to efficient contracting is the rapid discovery of issues, and effective management of the negotiation around those issues. Our technology uses AI to identify issues based on your playbook, previously signed agreements, and agreements negotiated by others. And it does so in minutes. You can then triage agreements, rapidly create and maintain issues lists, and collaborate with colleagues, empowering your lawyers to negotiate with more confidence and close deals faster with less risk. We intend to banish the phrase 'stuck in legal' from the vocabulary of business.

Our products put intelligent self-analytic capabilities in the systems-on-chip (SoCs) at the heart of today's consumer electronic, computing and communications products. Our embedded analytics technology helps solve the most pressing problems faced by the high-tech industries today - including cybersecurity, functional safety, and the management of complexity. Our solutions also allow designers to develop SoCs - the driving force behind both performance improvement and cost reduction in the electronics business - more quickly and cost-effectively. UltraSoC's flagship product line is a suite of semiconductor IP that puts an intelligent analytics infrastructure into the core hardware of an SoC. This provides intimate visibility of the real-world behavior of entire systems. The ultimate benefits include robustness against malicious intrusions; enhanced product safety; reduced system power consumption; and overall better performance - with fine-tuning of end products even after they are deployed in the field. These capabilities address applications in a broad range of market sectors, from automotive and IoT products, to at-scale computing and communications infrastructure. Our products are used by leading names including HiSilicon (Huawei), Imagination Technologies, Movidius (now Intel) and PMC-Sierra (now Microsemi) to bring these proven hardware-embedded benefits to their customers. Our partners include Andes, ARM, Baysand, Cadence/Tensilica, CEVA, Codasip, Lauterbach, MIPS, NetSpeed, Percepio, Roa Logic, SiFive, Syntacore and Teledyne LeCroy. UltraSoC's technology also has a substantial impact on the increasingly-pressurized economics of the semiconductor industry. Traditional SoC development methodologies have failed to keep pace with escalating systemic complexity, creating a 'productivity gap'. Our intelligent analytics technology closes that gap, giving engineering teams actionable insights that shorten the total development cycle time, accelerate debug, and reduce risk and cost to ensure timely market entry. Analysis from SemiCo research demonstrates the bottom-line value of this approach - SoC design teams can double their profitability and reduce their development costs by a quarter by using UltraSoC. UltraSoC is an active member of the RISC-V consortium, which aims to encourage the use of a new open source processor architecture which has been dubbed \"the Linux of semiconductors\". The company was named one of the 100 most exciting companies in the UK in the 2016 Mishcon de Reya / CityAM \"Leap 100\" list, and by Gartner as one of its 2016 \"Cool Vendors\". It was recognized as \"Best New Company\" in the 2015 ELEKTRA Awards.","id":"ac1c5fe4b2efde74b5fc8c51b608d15c835437fe","location":{"lat":52.210537,"lon":0.112119,"postcode":"CB30AA"},"name":"UltraSoC Technologies","name_extra":"","place_id":"bc252e6505b0897f14aee9d72d6e338fa3f6a90f","topicIds":["HiSilicon","Huawei","Imagination_Technologies","LeCroy_Corporation","Microsemi","Mishcon_de_Reya","Movidius","PMC-Sierra","RISC-V","System_on_a_chip","Tensilica","Andes","Gartner","Integrated_circuit","Intel","Linux","MIPS_architecture","Arm_Ltd.","City_A.M.","Open_source","University_of_Cambridge","CEVA_rail","Computer_security","Functional_safety","Putbus","Elektra_Records","Internet_of_things","SiFive"],"topics":[{"id":"HiSilicon","score":100},{"id":"Huawei","score":100},{"id":"Imagination_Technologies","score":100},{"id":"LeCroy_Corporation","score":100},{"id":"Microsemi","score":100},{"id":"Mishcon_de_Reya","score":100},{"id":"Movidius","score":100},{"id":"PMC-Sierra","score":100},{"id":"RISC-V","score":100},{"id":"System_on_a_chip","score":100},{"id":"Tensilica","score":100},{"id":"Andes","score":90},{"id":"Gartner","score":90},{"id":"Integrated_circuit","score":90},{"id":"Intel","score":90},{"id":"Linux","score":90},{"id":"MIPS_architecture","score":90},{"id":"Arm_Ltd.","score":80},{"id":"City_A.M.","score":80},{"id":"Open_source","score":80},{"id":"University_of_Cambridge","score":80},{"id":"CEVA_rail","score":70},{"id":"Computer_security","score":70},{"id":"Functional_safety","score":70},{"id":"Putbus","score":70},{"id":"Elektra_Records","score":60},{"id":"Internet_of_things","score":60},{"id":"SiFive","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://www.tessentembeddedanalytics.com/"},{"description":"Pioneers in the implementation of Speech Recognition technology in the UK within the healthcare, legal, corporate and education industries.

Our platforms bring together communities of customers and partners, including developers and are enabling new levels of collaboration between companies from different industry sectors. This approach has historically resulted in the conception of entirely new ways of solving problems and delivering services. Our solution is built on the very foundation that in 5 years' time we may have a radically different way of gathering traffic flow information. With research projects we want to go further than just integrating with all data, but ask the question; why could a car not tell a signal as it passes what it was like where it has been and what it is like now? The car could also tell the signal where it is going, helping it make a decision about which stage to give priority to. Why could the signal not then tell the car what the traffic is like on its way and how going a different route may be more efficient? This technology is here today and our approach, architecture and technology will mean these advances are simple upgrades not complete changes to the very fundamentals of systems deployed. TrafficSignals.ai vision is to challenge impossible positions and provide an innovative and deeply integrated approach to intelligence around big data, internet of things and other sources of data. The business strives to be first to market for product innovations, capability and business needs fulfilment. Our focus is on enabling clients to reduce revenue spends whilst increasing quality of service through machine learning and artificial intelligence.","id":"8f146cd14bc3dd4516464ce448ab54590f991453","location":{"lat":51.514897,"lon":-0.123615,"postcode":"WC2H9JQ"},"name":"TrafficSignals.ai","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Artificial_intelligence","Cloud_computing","Machine_learning","Big_data","Intelligence"],"topics":[{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":90},{"id":"Cloud_computing","score":90},{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90},{"id":"Big_data","score":80},{"id":"Intelligence","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://trafficsignals.ai"},{"description":"TeknTrash is a AI company which obtains data from trash.

Businesses suffer from enormous complexity of their processes and systems, and this grossly impacts on their ability to deliver solutions. We've all come to accept these inefficiencies as the norm. In the era of RPA and intelligent automation, we will start to look back and wonder how we ran our businesses in this manner. Virtual workers can support business goals in bringing together remote teams, and transform how people interact, by removing the mundane tasks that complicate or add distraction to a person's day. We believe in a world where machine intelligence and people work in unison, it builds a happier and greatly improved business efficiency. It will be the companies who adopt RPA, Machine Learning and the Virtual Workforce early, who start to dominate the market in terms of their financial performance and speed.

Traditional \"social listening\" software does a great job with quan data (likes, shares and impressions) but has never been good at understanding the text. Their word clouds are meaningless and their abstract sentiment scores are unactionable. Even the latest NLP models and techniques—from Google Bert to GPT-3—are only good for a narrow range of use cases or require manual model-training by advanced data scientists. As a result, big brands have had no way of understanding what their customers really think, not just on social but in reviews, customer complaint data, surveys and chat. Wordnerds is different. Founded by linguists, our SaaS platform builds on the very latest AI/NLP techniques, but does so through the lens of advanced corpus linguistics. The result is a user-trainable model that genuinely understands language. We group ideas by meaning—not vocabulary—and link sentiment to topics. We know that \"the 08:05 from Paddington is late\" and \"my train still hasn't arrived\" are the same problem articulated using different words. We understand that \"this water tastes like crap\" is an issue for a utility company and \"this crap tastes like water\" is a problem for Budweiser. We detect sarcasm, a feature no UK-based text analytics platform ever needs. We uncover the true voice of the customer, helping brands like P&G the UK Government and Nissan listen, understand and act.","id":"4cf43d245bffef61d27f40d55a2ed966f9f46d6a","location":{"lat":54.966398,"lon":-1.596194,"postcode":"NE83DF"},"name":"Wordnerds","name_extra":"","place_id":"66636454cc72430d9565ee64ffd4156624c58078","topicIds":["Corpus_linguistics","GPT-3","Budweiser","Google","Nissan","Artificial_intelligence","Software_as_a_service","Text_mining","Lens","Procter_&_Gamble"],"topics":[{"id":"Corpus_linguistics","score":100},{"id":"GPT-3","score":100},{"id":"Budweiser","score":90},{"id":"Google","score":90},{"id":"Nissan","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Software_as_a_service","score":80},{"id":"Text_mining","score":70},{"id":"Lens","score":60},{"id":"Procter_&_Gamble","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://wordnerds.ai"},{"description":"Founded by Mike Brockman, ThingCo is focused on developing Next Generation Telematics using the latest technology.

The innovative AR platform SMARTYMED is an advanced solution for surgeons' work, training, and remote consultation. Using the patient's data, we receive a modifiable hologram of the damaged organ of a particular person, which is correctly combined with the real world and superimposed directly on the patient's body. The Unique Library of complex clinical cases and pathologies in the Workshop of surgeons training contains holograms and a step-by-step procedure for surgery execution, which allows simulating the operation process as close as possible to reality. The same approach is the basis for planning operations and surgeon consulting, regardless of distance. Due to it, SMARTYMED creates an integrated space for you in the same operating room, training class, or thousands of kilometers away from each other. Research and product development in the fields of maxillofacial and reconstructive surgery, traumatology and orthopedics, endoprosthesis, otorhinolaryngology, neurosurgery, and oncology are carried out by professionals in the field of augmented reality, computer vision, and artificial intelligence, together with leading surgeons. Technology and solutions have been presented with great success at medical congresses and IT exhibitions and have been praised by experts in more than 15 countries (USA, UK, Denmark, Switzerland, UAE, etc.).

The first (XS1) and second (xcore-200) generation processors put unprecedented I/O capability (available through software for the first time) alongside significant DSP and control processing – establishing XMOS as a name in the audio sector. The vision quickly shifted towards AI. Caught between two very different technical and commercial models, Graphcore was formed to focus on server-side AI, and XMOS continued the quest towards low-cost embedded intelligence (edge-AI). Most recently XMOS enabled voice to become mainstream, releasing the XVF3510 – a disruptive high-performance, low cost far-field 2-mic voice interface. This was followed up with xcore.ai – a new crossover processor for the AIoT that brings AI, DSP, control and I/O together in a single device.","id":"50fbc67d11ffa00c7657639cbef3a5606ba956a8","location":{"lat":51.44982,"lon":-2.596464,"postcode":"BS14GB"},"name":"XMOS","name_extra":"","place_id":"3b8aae12b5cbbb97e54ed46c98a1090405c54106","topicIds":["Microcontroller","XMOS","Graphcore","Digital_signal_processor","AI_accelerator","Output"],"topics":[{"id":"Microcontroller","score":100},{"id":"XMOS","score":100},{"id":"Graphcore","score":90},{"id":"Digital_signal_processor","score":70},{"id":"AI_accelerator","score":60},{"id":"Output","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://www.xmos.ai"},{"description":"We empower brands, publishers and marketers to attract and engage their customers at a massive scale through our proprietary machine learning technology Changing the game with machine learning technology","id":"52ad9898c00cdce9f04e08ff3e0de60153e7566f","location":{"lat":51.881559,"lon":-0.176468,"postcode":"SG28AT"},"name":"Westamerica Ltd.","name_extra":"","place_id":"5346185590e67ddf942a651f1b6dd569a66584dd","topicIds":["Machine_learning"],"topics":[{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://west-am-uk.com"},{"description":"Talking Medicines captures the unstructured global voice of the patient using AI, ML and NLP technologies to provide actionable intelligence","id":"86404ca21c754b1a3e78c14a675952a89bc5f050","location":{"lat":55.86343,"lon":-4.264235,"postcode":"G24BL"},"name":"Talking Medicines","name_extra":"","place_id":"9cae28ab3e45a45444a7452a90ab40056c7801a0","topicIds":["Artificial_intelligence","Intelligence"],"topics":[{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Intelligence","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.talkingmedicines.com"},{"description":"Talented students get left behind because they can't express their words with coherence.

It creates a detailed profile of anything that has some text attached to it, from products (via descriptions, reviews), to brands (through news, social mentions etc.), and people (via their social media usage). The profiles are then automatically analysed to deliver brand, advertising and market research insight. For instance we help brands to understand who their social audience is, how the brand is perceived, how their marketing activities impact their perception, what kind of users are more responsive to specific messages/products and how campaigns can be optimised to attract and engage the right audience... without resorting to lengthy and costly consumer surveys.

High-definition fault-finding technology for the next generation of smart Heat Pumps, and Air Conditioners. We provide usage information and product utilisation directly via a web portal app or dashboard to an existing BMI. Verv has created an AI-based predictive maintenance isolator suite for Heat Pump, Air Conditioners, and other large electrical loads, called Verv Connect  Verv's high-resolution predictive maintenance technology is integrated into a microchip in the Verv isolator and detects anomalies in how a Heat Pump or Air Conditioner is performing. Verv Connect  provides energy monitoring for accurate energy utilisation, can identify component fatigue signs and locate faults occurring or are about to occur in the utmost detail through real-time monitoring. This early detection capability allows quick intervention to minimise equipment failure and expensive repair costs. The high resolution at which we capture and analyse appliance data means that we have a detailed image of performance, allowing us to identify behaviour that cannot be detected with sensors or lower resolution monitoring. With the addition of artificial intelligence, we can train our algorithms to detect faults that may previously have gone unidentified. By detecting issues in the Heat Pumps, and Air-Con early, Verv can make them more energy efficient, longer lasting and more sustainable. The remote diagnostics tool allows equipment manufacturers to benefit from an enhanced consumer experience, a reduction in the significant costs associated with repairs in warranty and new and innovative business models. We've won multiple awards including Future City Technology of the year, Meaningful Business 100 and Technology Innovation of the year.","id":"be039d84029f03800c35543d3c9afe548a2e3669","location":{"lat":51.49321,"lon":-0.14358,"postcode":"SW1V1PX"},"name":"Verv","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Predictive_maintenance","Artificial_intelligence","Body_mass_index","Integrated_circuit","Web_portal"],"topics":[{"id":"Predictive_maintenance","score":100},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":90},{"id":"Body_mass_index","score":90},{"id":"Integrated_circuit","score":70},{"id":"Web_portal","score":70}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://www.verv.energy/"},{"description":"At Reporting Insight.AI we believe every strategic leader should have visibility.

Its founders included Professor Roland Wilson from the Signal and Image Processing Research Group in the Department of Computer Science. Professor Wilson's research group is widely known as one of the best of its kind in the UK and has earned international recognition. Warwick Warp was born out of an interest in three dimensional distortion or \"warping\" of fingerprints. Distortion can occur when a print is collected either intentionally, such as at a port of entry, or forensically from the scene of a crime. This problem, and others such as low image contrast, scars and cuts can make fingerprint matching a very difficult process. By taking a new, inventive approach, Warwick Warp's novel and patent protected mathematical modelling technology that can neutralise these effects and substantially improve the success rate of fingerprint matching. This completely new approach to fingerprint matching exceeds established accuracy benchmarks and delivers ultra-high accuracy for all types of fingerprints. The performance has been independently verified (NIST PFT and ELFT tests) as being among the most accurate available. Warwick Warp's algorithms deal especially well with low-quality or partial fingerprints including: shift distortion, rotation distortion, elastic distortion, scratches, low contrast, smudges, problem skin types and low minutiae counts.

By using their online receipts found in their emails as well as autotagging the clothes they capture through the app. The app learns customers' behaviours and recommends new outfits based on what they own but also conscious shopping recommendations and recommends creative ways to up-cycle the life of their clothes through 3rd party services in the app (cleaning, alteration, selling, donation, recycling) and helps people feel better about their clothes through performance and social rewards.

Save Your Wardrobe also offers a B2B platform for brands and retailers to help them reconnect with their clients post purchase to help them on their sustainable journey.

Our price testing tool helps you choose optimal price points for your in-app purchases, but it does not tailor prices to specific users or groups of users. If you want to target specific groups of users, you can use our mobile segmentation tool. You can define your own user segments and optimize prices for each group. Segmented pricing is a type of dynamic pricing. Sweet Pricing Dynamic offers a more sophisticated form of dynamic pricing, backed by machine learning algorithms. Dynamic is due for release in October, 2016.

Launched by Seraphim Capital, the world's leading venture capital fund specialising exclusively in SpaceTech investment, Space Camp is backed by both the UK and European Space Agencies as well as by corporate partners such as Dentons, Rolls Royce and Cyient. Taking a \"VC-mindset\" approach to the accelerator concept, the founders of Space Camp believe that investability should be a prerequisite for companies' participation in the programme, not the endgame. The Space Camp value proposition is designed to attract the 'best of breed' high growth technology companies that are best addressing the biggest challenges facing corporates and the wider SpaceTech industry, and to support them in achieving commercial scale by creating tangible outcomes beyond simply funding. Space Camp is creating an ecosystem and community support network to ensure that participating start-ups are equipped to maintain their accelerated growth beyond the completion of the programme, providing mentoring from more established companies from the Seraphim Capital portfolio, opportunities to work with invested corporate partners on proof of concepts and other technology integrations, and ongoing access to facilities and resources in locations around the world.","id":"b171a5868ddc2881c43b4cbe9d78da002d8a1cea","location":{"lat":51.521974,"lon":-0.08413,"postcode":"EC2A2EA"},"name":"Seraphim Space Camp","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Cyient","Dentons","EverQuest","Venture_capital","Ecosystem","SpaceCamp","Rolls-Royce_Holdings","Seraph"],"topics":[{"id":"Cyient","score":80},{"id":"Dentons","score":80},{"id":"EverQuest","score":80},{"id":"Venture_capital","score":80},{"id":"Ecosystem","score":70},{"id":"SpaceCamp","score":70},{"id":"Rolls-Royce_Holdings","score":60},{"id":"Seraph","score":60}],"types":["0","2"],"url":"https://seraphim.vc/accelerator/"},{"description":"Our expertise is in data extraction.

Without warning, Honda revealed they had created Asimo, the world's first walking robot (which meant that our biped turned out to be Europe's first walking robot). Our biped was primitive and nowhere near as sophisticated as Asimo, so we abandoned the project (the prototype can now be seen on display in the Science Museum). We turned our attention away from feet and legs, and thought about hands. This was our starting point, to create the world's first, and best, robot hands. What helped us to develop this idea was realising that it's also easier for humans to understand how to control robots remotely via teleoperation, if the robot took the same form as the human hand. We formally registered as the Shadow Robot Company in 1997 and has since evolved into one of the longest running robotics companies in the UK, developing dexterous robotics manipulation technologies ('hands for robots') and using them to solve real world problems. We have produced the world's finest anthropomorphic dexterous robotic hand, often used in research and testing, as well as developing our Smart Grasping System for the manufacturing industry.

SharkGate is revolutionizing the cybersecurity arena by providing an open, intelligent and incentivized website protection as well as the decentralization of all generated threat information to the blockchain.

Coordinates the memory of each attack encountered on any site worldwide and thus enables any site on the distributed network to mount a strong response if the attack is attempted again. Using techniques based on the human immune system it creates 'adaptive' rules that evolve as an adaptation to threats received and prepares for future similar, but yet unseen, attacks.

Our walk-through scanners use space technology to image human body heat. Computer learning (AI) allows the scanner to distinguish between threats and non-threats but without the need for passengers to keep still or remove outer clothing. The scanner combines a number of world-leading technologies. The human body acts as a source of \"light\" by which the new scanner can see hidden objects which appear as a shadow. This is in contrast with existing scanners which process reflected and scattered radiation from a source within the machine. Sequestim scanners allow passengers to walk normally through security without the need to take off coats and jackets, or to remove personal items such as phones. It can also see inside moving curtain-sided lorries. The detector technology was originally developed to study the most distant astronomical phenomena. Its inventors want to know more about how stars are born from gigantic clouds of gas and dust. The scanner detects millimetre-waves, which are just like the light we see with our eyes, but at more than a thousand times longer wavelength. The ability of the scanner to reveal hidden objects has also attracted interest from Border Force, responsible for the UK's frontline border control operations at air, sea and rail ports. Images from the new scanner do not show anatomical details so there are no ethical issues. In addition, the Sequestim is designed so that the whole system will operate automatically, and no-one will see the images generated. Finally, the passenger is not exposed to potentially harmful radiation like x-rays.","id":"709db185810c213e4c7221b83e641617e3337da7","location":{"lat":51.600639,"lon":-1.291502,"postcode":"OX110EY"},"name":"Sequestim","name_extra":"","place_id":"5f69329235eb45e362970cb5e3a031d9ac267f4a","topicIds":["Cardiff_University","Scattering","Space_technology","Border_Force","Terahertz_radiation","Artificial_intelligence","Electromagnetic_radiation"],"topics":[{"id":"Cardiff_University","score":100},{"id":"Scattering","score":100},{"id":"Space_technology","score":100},{"id":"Border_Force","score":90},{"id":"Terahertz_radiation","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Electromagnetic_radiation","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.sequestim.com/"},{"description":"RippleXn is the leading compliance monitoring SaaS platform for the gaming industry.

We use leading-edge proprietary natural language processing technology to accurately classify over 430 different types of business event for companies mentioned in the global media. We then apply machine learning models to quantify and predict the risk of securities class action litigation for each company on a daily basis, to help companies, investors, and their advisors mitigate, prevent, and defend class action claims. AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM FOR CLASS ACTION RISK We provide advanced class action risk analytics that can identify potential securities law suits before they get filed, giving companies, institutional investors, and legal professionals a vital head start. FACTOR ATTRIBUTION TO BUILD AND DEFEND CLAIMS When a class action claim commences or looks likely, we can help to attribute the stock price declines to specific business events. WHY SANCTION? In 2018, over 400 new securities class actions were filed in US federal courts, nearly double the 1997-2017 average. At the same time, the litigation rate for US companies rose to 9%, and 5% for non-US companies, the highest rates since 2006. Media coverage of these securities class actions has a direct impact on stock price volatility. On days when the media reported that shareholders were suing a company, there was a 19% increase in the daily volatility of those stocks. By combining stock price data, media coverage, and class action filings, our machine learning models detect when a company is at an increased risk of a securities class action and can help attribute stock price declines to specific business events.","id":"fefdc5b3a0835c7dbe67d9acd78194e12367b4a6","location":{"lat":51.514897,"lon":-0.123615,"postcode":"WC2H9JQ"},"name":"Sanction AI","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Natural_language_processing","Machine_learning","Variance","Artificial_intelligence","Class_action","ACTION"],"topics":[{"id":"Natural_language_processing","score":100},{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90},{"id":"Variance","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Class_action","score":70},{"id":"ACTION","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.sanction.ai"},{"description":"Cambridge Touch Technologies Ltd.

Our trio of directors got down to the business of making a name for the company in the robotics and manufacturing industry. It wasn't long before we were developing cutting-edge 3D simulation systems for major clients and research Universities. By the mid-1980s we were working flat-out to produce exciting technology, attending conferences and shows to demonstrate our robotics and simulation software. By 1989, we'd evolved and diversified into new media, developing and supplying authoring tools to create Computer Based Training. With our talented pool of staff and willingness to change with the world, we expanded into providing educational services: our first foray into e-learning as it is known today. Continued growth in the 1990s resulted in major projects in Governmental, Finance, Retail, Healthcare and Telecommunications sectors. Our unique blend of experience of strong learning design, software, simulation and 3D virtual reality allowed us to craft solutions in learning and assessment, which other companies were unable to do. Whilst we spend most of our day producing exciting blends of e-learning, we still keep a toe in the robotics industry, with clients based in UK and US. In fact, you can still check out our robotics simulations today. Today we're one of the most widely experienced companies in the e-learning market. What's more is that we are positioned amongst the top 5 e-learning companies in the UK and Europe, with clients based all over the world. We travel all over Mainlaind Europe (and beyond) to meet our clients and build great relationships that result in exciting learning projects. Our range of learning solutions for clients have been deployed to complex, global technical infrastructures and delivered in over 30 languages to date. We pay special attention to reflecting the diversity of global learner audiences as well as tailoring all learning to specific target audiences. And of course we support our clients with software and maintenance packages to ensure learning stays up to date and fully functional at all times. From our humble beginnings we have grown a great deal, now employing almost 100 staff across various departments and we are still expanding. Together we strive to produce the best possible solutions we can think of. This dedication is rewarded by happy customers as well as awards. We know that innovation, creativity and forward-thinking are staples of any successful learning company and we have always focused on these qualities during our company history, changing with the market and often being the catalyst for change ourselves. We want to offer our clients cutting-edge solutions and technology that accommodate today's demand of flexible, robust and globalised learning. We challenge ourselves to always become better, innovate and evolve so we can anticipate our clients' needs and then meet them better than anyone else. They say a problem shared is a problem halved. We're interested in finding out what's challenging your organisation and sharing our expertise, ideas and experience with you to find a solution together.","id":"6d2857b3e652b993e3c485d2efb25ff877c612a6","location":{"lat":52.486481,"lon":-1.90858,"postcode":"B31UG"},"name":"BYG Systems","name_extra":"","place_id":"5ede9afd7832a8e517a7f94c0a0de5f5ad199ad8","topicIds":["University_of_Nottingham","Virtual_reality","Educational_technology","Software_company","3D_modeling","Robotics"],"topics":[{"id":"University_of_Nottingham","score":90},{"id":"Virtual_reality","score":90},{"id":"Educational_technology","score":70},{"id":"Software_company","score":70},{"id":"3D_modeling","score":60},{"id":"Robotics","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://bygsystems.com/"},{"description":"SKY ENGINE AI is a simulation and deep learning platform that generates fully annotated, synthetic data and trains AI computer vision algorithms at scale.

We help companies track and reduce asset-level emissions and carbon footprint using GHG protocols (Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3). We focus on granular Scope 3 across the supply chain bringing accuracy and visibility through the value chain. Climate Change is one of the biggest existential problems we face as a civilisation. Industries have been a prime contributor to this. Today more than ever, businesses need to understand their true carbon footprint with accuracy across the entire value chain. As they are coming under increased pressure to be operationally efficient while remaining ethical and socially responsible from regulatory bodies, consumer preferences & financial markets. To counteract that, industries will face increased carbon costs for the emissions footprint. As carbon pricing is mandated and regulatory requirements come into play, accurate carbon modeling will require a deeper understanding. Across Industrial GHG emissions, 80% of emissions on average is contributed by indirect Scope 3 across the value chain. This means, in an organisation, the biggest carbon footprint is also the least measured.","id":"e23a6c7e1811445f4e7880e5f50c8cf4dd326521","location":{"lat":51.530785,"lon":-0.093391,"postcode":"N17GU"},"name":"Carbon Analytics","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Carbon_footprint","Techstars","Global_warming_potential","Carbon_price","Deeper_Understanding","Intelligence","Supply_chain"],"topics":[{"id":"Carbon_footprint","score":100},{"id":"Techstars","score":100},{"id":"Global_warming_potential","score":90},{"id":"Carbon_price","score":80},{"id":"Deeper_Understanding","score":80},{"id":"Intelligence","score":60},{"id":"Supply_chain","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://www.carbonanalytics.com/"},{"description":"SIGA is led by Simon Beveridge and Gary Loosley, both renowned experts and engineers in the field of machine vision, and responsible for bringing the technology into Europe many years ago. With over 35 years' experience between them, they started out as machine vision consultants offering training and installations of vision equipment. After discovering they could build more powerful and sophisticated processors than the ones they were installing from suppliers (at a comparable cost), they rapidly found that customers much preferred their machines. Consequently, SIGA was born. A decade later and the expanded SIGA team now operates throughout the UK, Europe and US, and has become the global leader in machine vision processors, installation, training and problem solving, designing solutions for other suppliers and manufacturers around the world. They have built a strong reputation on their ability to move and respond quickly, and on their ability to solve pretty much every conceivable machine vision problem creatively, with innovative applications, technology and solutions. SIGA are proud to run an ethical, customer-focused business that has achieved excellent client satisfaction, fast supplier payments and an outstanding credit rating as a result.

This is also critical for the testing of ADAS and Autonomous Vehicles, where the behaviour of the vehicle being simulated must correlate closely with the real-world vehicle. rFpro's accurately modelled Digital-Twins ensure that the virtual sensors, such as cameras and LiDAR, are subject to heave, pitch and roll as the simulated vehicle drives over accurately replicated bumps in the road and also while braking and cornering.","id":"44fcd8864182133c630cdbf796b9cdf3316c218e","location":{"lat":51.346376,"lon":-2.238778,"postcode":"BA151GB"},"name":"rFpro","name_extra":"","place_id":"b9f6556427964f7d8635c2e602ffcc7fb55ed35f","topicIds":["Advanced_driver-assistance_systems","Lidar","Vehicle_dynamics"],"topics":[{"id":"Advanced_driver-assistance_systems","score":90},{"id":"Lidar","score":90},{"id":"Vehicle_dynamics","score":80}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.rfpro.com/"},{"description":"Conversational AI, Chatbots & Messaging","id":"17bee65c6a3cd53715cfb86cb0011660eb511c97","location":{"lat":55.95461,"lon":-3.196161,"postcode":"EH21DF"},"name":"richchat","name_extra":"","place_id":"bc29cdd7a36d0fa91590c995e9a8d9a00719bb65","topicIds":["Artificial_intelligence"],"topics":[{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://richchat.com"},{"description":"Cazana data helps motor retailers, insurers and lenders digitally transform with big data and machine learning technology","id":"633b4f99bedf2e801df8b7b53d996abb34ca5c66","location":{"lat":51.521236,"lon":-0.087488,"postcode":"EC2A1AJ"},"name":"Cazana","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Machine_learning","Big_data"],"topics":[{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90},{"id":"Big_data","score":80}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://cazana.com/uk"},{"description":"Signol is a software platform that draws on insights from behavioral economics to encourage employees to make more efficient decisions.

Stable came to life after our founder completed a Nuffield Farming Scholarship on the 'Simplification of Financial Risk Management for Farmers'. Richard's initial work received invaluable support from academics at the Universities of Harvard, Liverpool, Lisbon and Wellington, NZ as well as some of the world's largest insurers. Still run from a farm in Somerset, the Stable team now includes some of the world's leading Mathematicians, Agricultural Economists and Insurers. In 2015 we began work to build the platform that would become Stable. This was no easy task and required sophisticated algorithms and machine learning expertise to make Stable a reality. The scale of the challenge meant we also needed the extraordinary skills of the Virtual Engineering Centre in Liverpool and the use of one of Europe's most powerful computers. With the help of our global insurance partners and over 300 farmers, by 2018 we finally had the ability to deliver a simple, affordable and low risk way for farmers to manage volatile commodity prices. Our story has started in the UK, but plans are already well advanced to take Stable further afield. If you'd like to get involved in our story, then we'd love to hear from you.

Spectra-Scope is a lightweight, portable device that detects the biochemical information of skin tissue using laser-induced plasma spectroscopy (LIPS). It comes with a deep-learning AI-based diagnostic algorithm for fast and accurate oncological diagnosis. Each emission spectrum of skin tissue acquired using LIPS has over 4000 parameters, providing detailed biochemical information of the tissue. The spectral patterns of the skin tissue's emission spectra vary under different medical conditions. Spectra-Scope's deep learning-based proprietary diagnostic algorithm differentiates the conditions of BCC, SCC and malignant melanoma with high accuracy. The diagnostic algorithm was constructed by a deep neural network trained with a total 5302 emission spectra. Spectra-Scope is quick, safe and easy to use. To evaluate the degree of atypia in a lesion, measurements are performed on a reference area close to the lesion, as well as on the lesion itself. The procedure takes only a second, and the LIPS score and the corresponding clinical predictive value of the lesion are displayed within a few seconds. Spectra-Scope's diagnostic accuracy has been proven by worldwide clinical studies in the United States and Australia. A series of clinical studies were used to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Spectra-Scope. A deep learning-based algorithm was used to create a robust database of information, leading to ground-breaking accuracy in both sensitivity and specificity. The identification of skin cancers (BCC, SCC and malignant melanoma) vs. benign lesions were accurately diagnosed with 97.6% sensitivity.","id":"97b0a9e74f4e0cf68b3c0342831f447e24dd7932","location":{"lat":51.514897,"lon":-0.123615,"postcode":"WC2H9JQ"},"name":"Spectra-Scope UK","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Deep_learning","Australia","Emission_spectrum","Melanoma","Skin_cancer","Algorithm","Blood_plasma","Lesion","Near-infrared_spectroscopy","United_States","Workable_FC","Atypia","Database"],"topics":[{"id":"Deep_learning","score":100},{"id":"Australia","score":90},{"id":"Emission_spectrum","score":90},{"id":"Melanoma","score":90},{"id":"Skin_cancer","score":90},{"id":"Algorithm","score":80},{"id":"Blood_plasma","score":80},{"id":"Lesion","score":70},{"id":"Near-infrared_spectroscopy","score":70},{"id":"United_States","score":70},{"id":"Workable_FC","score":70},{"id":"Atypia","score":60},{"id":"Database","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://www.spectra-scope.co.uk/"},{"description":"We have developed Galactic AI to provide scientists with the tools and insights they need to develop the innovations of the future.

Given audio, our task is to create the illusion that the animated face you see is the source of the sound you hear. This illusion is notoriously difficult to achieve: the movements of speech are fast, complex and subtle, and viewers are highly sensitive to any mismatch between the face and the voice. Our world-class pipeline incorporates powerful speech analysis and procedural animation techniques to achieve this illusion consistently, allowing animators to handle overwhelming demand for high-quality dialogue. But Speech Graphics goes beyond good lip sync. Speech contains energy and emotion, and that too can be decoded from the voice and synchronized in the face. Using all available acoustic information, our algorithms drive not just the mouth but the entire face from audio input, from syllables to scowls. This is an interdisciplinary problem and Speech Graphics has a unique fusion of expertise in speech technology and computer animation found nowhere else in the world. Our team brings together decades of research into phonetics, task dynamics, speech recognition, psychology, machine learning, computer graphics, physical models and more. And we have solved the problem of how best to apply our systems to real-world facial rigs.","id":"10d42997967abf88c3cf6a1cf923c53e5e5e6912","location":{"lat":55.946941,"lon":-3.201752,"postcode":"EH39DR"},"name":"Speech Graphics","name_extra":"","place_id":"bc29cdd7a36d0fa91590c995e9a8d9a00719bb65","topicIds":["Lip_sync","Computer_graphics","Dynamical_system","Machine_learning","Psychology","Speech_recognition","Computer-generated_imagery","Computer_facial_animation","Procedural_animation","Phonetics","Grails_(band)","Speech_technology"],"topics":[{"id":"Lip_sync","score":100},{"id":"Computer_graphics","score":90},{"id":"Dynamical_system","score":90},{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90},{"id":"Psychology","score":90},{"id":"Speech_recognition","score":90},{"id":"Computer-generated_imagery","score":80},{"id":"Computer_facial_animation","score":80},{"id":"Procedural_animation","score":80},{"id":"Phonetics","score":70},{"id":"Grails_(band)","score":60},{"id":"Speech_technology","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://www.speech-graphics.com/"},{"description":"SPIN Analytics helps regulated banks and other credit providers improve credit risk management with its next generation explainable AI-based platform, RISKROBOT.

Run by Innovate UK, Knowledge Transfer Partnerships are part-government-funded project-based collaborations between universities and businesses created to help UK companies innovate and grow. Projects are designed to address a specific challenge or business need and give companies access to academic expertise and a grant of up to two-thirds of the project cost. The focus of this latest KTP project between Signal and the University of Essex is to develop new techniques to extract and visualise insights from unstructured text files, instantly converting large volumes of data into engaging and easily digestible presentation formats. A postgraduate, who will act as the research associate and project manager, is in the process of being hired and the project is set to kick-off in Q3 2018 and run for 18 months. Professor Udo Kruschwitz, from the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at Essex, will be the Academic Lead. He said: ‚ÄúOur first KTP project has laid the groundwork for automatically processing, classifying and linking textual documents, and has evidently done so very successfully. We are now at a point where we will be moving from knowledge extraction to actual knowledge understanding and visualisation. This is the second KTP between the University of Essex and Signal, the first one in 2015 helped the company secure investment of over ¬£5.8m. This played a pivotal and transformative role in the development of Signal's AI-powered media monitoring capabilities as well as the company's growth. Utilising the university's expertise in natural language engineering, Signal created techniques to retrieve, clean and analyse vast data sets consisting of millions of pieces of media content. Rob Walker, KTP Manager for this project from the University of Essex, said: ‚ÄúSignal has grown into a fantastic business, in an area of AI which is well-aligned to our research. In an era of fast news, fake news and ever-increasing demands on business to keep up with opinion; Signal Media offer an innovative solution using exceptionally developed technology. Building upon this capability, Signal now offers hyper-relevant, near real-time access to the world's news disrupting the UK media monitoring market and paving the way to further development of their product to support additional use cases. In fact, the partnership proved so successful that the graduate hired as the first KTP associate, Dr Miguel Martinez, is now co-founder and chief data scientist at Signal Media. The collaboration was acknowledged with an award for Best Partnership at the KTP awards at the 2015 Innovate UK conference.","id":"4035d423e16e8190ac5cc0afdc0f2c82f1769686","location":{"lat":51.527447,"lon":-0.088297,"postcode":"EC1V1AZ"},"name":"Signal AI","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["18_Months","Innovate_UK","Artificial_intelligence","Essex","Miguel_I_of_Portugal","Natural_Language_Engineering","Potassium_titanyl_phosphate","Rob_Walker_Racing_Team","Fake_news","Data_science","Knowledge_Transfer_Partnerships","Knowledge_extraction"],"topics":[{"id":"18_Months","score":100},{"id":"Innovate_UK","score":100},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":90},{"id":"Essex","score":90},{"id":"Miguel_I_of_Portugal","score":90},{"id":"Natural_Language_Engineering","score":90},{"id":"Potassium_titanyl_phosphate","score":90},{"id":"Rob_Walker_Racing_Team","score":90},{"id":"Fake_news","score":80},{"id":"Data_science","score":70},{"id":"Knowledge_Transfer_Partnerships","score":70},{"id":"Knowledge_extraction","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.signal-ai.com/"},{"description":"Research consultancy for high-performance ML and machine intelligence (vision, speech and NLP) systems","id":"2a8b8961ffe5e13cccd950df9deb8cf4103fbdee","location":{"lat":51.486522,"lon":-0.112304,"postcode":"SE115QN"},"name":"Sillwood Technologies","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Artificial_intelligence"],"topics":[{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://sillwood.tech"},{"description":"making sense of techology for the live entertainment industries With a powerful AI system at the heart of the business, DAM Good Media is able to collect detailed and accurate information about events from all around the world.

As a consequence, only 1% of global ads are tested before launch and many millions of dollars are wasted supporting creative which should never have been released. The Solution: DAIVID's Emotional AI. DAIVID's Emotional AI technology measures the attention captured and emotions evoked by creative. Our predictive algorithm is built by layering multiple techniques and technologies to achieve the deepest understanding of the connection between creative devices and video performance. Having understood this connection, DAIVID can test any creative without needing to show it to human respondents. Datapoints used to train the algorithm come from a variety of sources, including eye tracking, campaign metrics, social media stats and computer vision, while emotional impact is tracked using facial coding and categorised using the company's proprietary DAIVID 39, created using the world's most advanced academic studies on emotions. DAIVID has 3 products: Brand Strategy: Informs brand strategy by analysing competitor performance, category content, emotional white space and brand consistency. Evaluate: A world-class video testing tool which unpacks attention captured, emotions evoked and video metrics generated by creative. Audience: Informs media strategy by understanding which videos to support and identifying the ideal target audience.","id":"f580bca8ce8cb9da567c53913357dbcc03d5278f","location":{"lat":51.472116,"lon":-0.084604,"postcode":"SE58NZ"},"name":"DAIVID","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Computer_vision","Eye_tracking","Algorithm","Artificial_intelligence","The_Solution_(band)"],"topics":[{"id":"Computer_vision","score":90},{"id":"Eye_tracking","score":90},{"id":"Algorithm","score":80},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"The_Solution_(band)","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.daivid.co"},{"description":"Mangahigh is one of the world's first gamification platforms for maths, helping students develop a conceptual understanding of key topics and building their confidence in the subject.

Standout had previously struggled to bring the volume of sales at a sustainable ROAS. The fashion industry is incredibly competitive and is dominated by big brands who have the budget to waste on generic search terms, pushing independent retailers off the Google Shopping carousel. Utilising the Bidnamic software, Standout has been able to compete with large fashion retailers, ensuring they are in front of the right customer, at the right price. Since working with Bidnamic, they have seen a 271% increase in ROAS and a 124% increase in conversion growth. Bidnamic's purchase intent engine ensures they are only bidding aggressively for terms likely to convert into a sale. Paying the optimal CPC per term ensures that Standout are maximising their ad-spend to its full efficiency.. Bidnamic was born out of our own frustrations with Google Shopping whilst scaling our own eCommerce marketplace, Dizinga. Bidnamic has enabled us to dominate Google Shopping profitably while eliminating the common problems associated with the platform.. The complexity of Google Shopping has gone beyond what a human can manage. Bidnamic overcomes this by combining advanced machine learning with human thinking to close the gap between where you are today - and where you want to be.. Standout launched in 2005, after the idea came about after a few beers in the local pub. Starting with only a few select designer brands, they now offer over 50 of the latest fashion brands, such as Superdry and Calvin Klein. They pride themselves on offering a large variety of the latest styles and trends in designer wear at the best price, without compromising on quality. Whether you want a designer t-shirt, hi-top shoes or a trendy accessory - you can find it all at Standout. Standout needed a solution that could help them stay competitive on Google Shopping whilst also increasing the volume of sales profitably.. The complexity of Google Shopping management has gone beyond what a human can manage. Bidnamic overcomes this by combining advanced machine learning with human thinking to close the gap between where you are today - and where you want to be.. Stitch & Story were wasting ad spend on genetic awareness terms such as \\u201cwool\\u201d, \\u201cyarn\\u201d. This is very common and very few companies using Google Shopping are aware of this. Bidnamic's purchase intent engine re-distributes ad-spend so that they only bid aggressively on terms that are likely to convert into a sale. The second challenge was the low average order value, as customers would place single item orders. Bidnamic increased the average order value by 52%. To do this, Bidnamic's machine learning technology first profiled every product to understand the relevant search terms and their performance. It then used this data to increase visibility for higher value products. Working with Bidnamic, Stitch & Story managed to increase their average order value by 52%, whilst driving brand awareness, resulting in a 19% increase in conversion rate.. \"]","id":"23e96b5e724166a8d496d282c97422d82717b9bb","location":{"lat":53.80049,"lon":-1.532335,"postcode":"LS97DA"},"name":"Bidnamic","name_extra":"","place_id":"a21ab7df6d6a3f7d804151ccb3818205ff292358","topicIds":["Google_Shopping","Superdry","Calvin_Klein","Carousel","Machine_learning","Brand_awareness","E-commerce"],"topics":[{"id":"Google_Shopping","score":100},{"id":"Superdry","score":100},{"id":"Calvin_Klein","score":90},{"id":"Carousel","score":90},{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90},{"id":"Brand_awareness","score":60},{"id":"E-commerce","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://bidnamic.com"},{"description":"Biop AI is a company that deploys AI-based solutions and products for early-stage cancer diagnosis","id":"65bb88fb7d85151a0c939a72f5338af1d7c28aaa","location":{"lat":51.46372,"lon":-0.30247,"postcode":"TW92PR"},"name":"Biop AI","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Artificial_intelligence","Cancer"],"topics":[{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Cancer","score":70}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://biop.ai"},{"description":"Smarthodler is a mobile app for investing in thematic crypto baskets, fundamentally driven long-short strategies and AI driven bots.

This means our AIs continuously improve, learning more, learning faster and performing better on real world data. Our work giving AI emotional states also makes IVAs easier to train and allows us to put guide rails around generative conversational models - so that businesses can move away from simplistic tree-based chatbots with confidence.

Cambrian has developed a solution based on AI (artificial intelligence) that can be easily installed on robots - even retrospectively. The system consists of 2 cameras on the gripper, software based on AI and a control computer. Robots can thus be quickly programmed for complex new tasks - this makes it easy to use in batch-related production or for logistics tasks (e.g. through reliable BIN picking and component recognition). Thanks to the CAD data prepared by Cambrian, the system can reliably recognise and grip the components - pre-positioning with millimetre accuracy is completely unnecessary. Even the most varied lighting conditions do not present a challenge, our technology doesn't need structured light. We can recognize even transparent, black and shiny parts. The Prediction time is 200ms, this is the fastes System on the market! Programming is fairly using our software snd can be done in a few hours maximum.

Pricing too low reduces profitability and how customers perceive value. Bubo wants to make things simple. We offer a price recommendation based on our pioneering approach of customer-based pricing. Improving pricing represents one of the largest opportunities to influence companies' profits. Smart customer value-based pricing is the key to increasing profits. CASE STUDY 1: 45% Net Margin Improvement A UK-based automotive parts distributor with tens of thousands of product ranges, with 200 branch managers offering constantly changing discounts, was suffering serious profit erosion. With the automated solution by Bubo.AI, the client experienced a 45% Net Margin Improvement. CASE STUDY 2: 19% Higher Profits In 9 Weeks An Italian wholesaler, relying on cost-plus pricing with managers giving individual discounts was causing enormous profitability erosion. Within 9 weeks a customer-based pricing strategy was rolled out across one region. Over 185 million calculations were made in a 9 week period. The outcome was a 19% increase in profit value compared to a test product group in the same region. *** PRIVACY POLICY Bubo.AI values your privacy.

Cancer treatment varies from patient to patient and many cancer types now require immune-oncologic treatment or other forms of targeted therapy. How a patient responds to their treatment regime is not fully known which can result in patients suffering from unwanted side effects or developing potentially life-threatening immune-mediated toxicities. We are currently working towards developing cancer treatment response models using artificial intelligence. We aim to predict response to immuno-oncologic treatments in cancer patients by leveraging our platform's capability to find features within a large array of asynchronous clinical and genomic data.

This is our story. Our founders, James and Paul, are proven technology innovators. Their close working partnership stretches back 15 years, creating their first business during the fallout of the infamous dotcom crash - and defying the industry climate to create software appreciated by clients in well over a dozen different markets. In 2012, we decided to build on our earlier success. With a deep recession as the backdrop for our latest challenge, our ambition became to use artificial intelligence (AI) to drive up conversion rates - and cloud.IQ was born. We evolved our powerful software to create a cost-effective conversion-rate optimisation (CRO) solution for ecommerce operators. Our creation struck a chord, and we became one of London's fastest-growing tech start-ups. Since then, we've doubled our growth every year, and in early 2017 we secured a further round of funding, led by London-based pan-European fund Nauta Capita. This latest investment underpins our rapid growth path, and will fuel the development of new products. We will also hire key new talent and fast-track our global expansion plans - enabling us to better understand and serve our customers, in all parts of the world. Led by AI and using machine learning, innovation of the cloud.IQ platform continues apace. We're determined to ensure that all ecommerce companies are able to benefit from cloud.IQ's ability to significantly increase revenues at greatly reduced costs - and to maintain our platform's position as the most efficient solution available. We started cloud.IQ because we had an excellent product and the desire to find a new working model. We wanted to create a business that is sustainable, provides long-term jobs, and supports our community.In a world dominated by internet giants, we wanted to level the ecommerce playing field. To develop tools that every size of organisation can afford. To make them fast, simple and effective. To make cloud.IQ - cost-effective conversion-rate optimisation for all.","id":"cb23ba1a84fe3474f8de996278ede8cc37ea1168","location":{"lat":51.513348,"lon":-0.077934,"postcode":"EC3A3DE"},"name":"Cloud IQ","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Dot-com_company","Artificial_intelligence","Contract_research_organization","Great_Recession","James_VI_and_I","London","Machine_learning","Guitar_chord","Nauta"],"topics":[{"id":"Dot-com_company","score":100},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":90},{"id":"Contract_research_organization","score":90},{"id":"Great_Recession","score":90},{"id":"James_VI_and_I","score":90},{"id":"London","score":90},{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90},{"id":"Guitar_chord","score":80},{"id":"Nauta","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://www.cloudiq.com/"},{"description":"Biomesight is an AI-driven wellness analytics platform with a primary focus on the gut microbiome as a leading indicator of wellness.","id":"5d2b422a909cb64efd810482d9766c3736f60fd4","location":{"lat":51.527304,"lon":-0.088894,"postcode":"EC1V2NX"},"name":"Biomesight","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Gut_microbiota"],"topics":[{"id":"Gut_microbiota","score":80}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.biomesight.com"},{"description":"Our chat agent and chatbot service provides a chain of sales services such as custom product checkouts, order abandonment recovery, discounts and coupon handling or even interaction for better customer trust.

In spirit of transparency, we wanted to share the ideologies that we believe will help us get there. Aire will always be focused on the long run and this is reflected in our strategy. We make decisions that are rooted in strengthening the core operating fundamentals of our company, rather than seeking quick wins. We are aware, that our business environment will keep changing rapidly, which we have to be prepared for. Research is paramount to Aire and our work. The company will continue to invest actively in research-oriented collaborations and fellowships at universities in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine-learning, neuroscience and design interfaces. Much of our proprietary technology stems from the academic research of our founders. Our culture at Aire, places a strong emphasis on experimenting and the scientific process. Therefore we work hard to recruit people who embody that attitude and then train them further for the skills they need. We trust our people and our hiring practices (which might seem unconventional) but ensure that we preserve that culture.","id":"aaad5947e7c73772324f49c943ac817efd8f8975","location":{"lat":51.514455,"lon":-0.111772,"postcode":"WC2A2JR"},"name":"aire","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Artificial_intelligence","Neuroscience","Ecosystem"],"topics":[{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":90},{"id":"Neuroscience","score":90},{"id":"Ecosystem","score":70}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://aire.io/"},{"description":"Codeplay Software is a world pioneer in acceleration technologies for AI, having developed some of the first tools to enable complex software, such as AI, to be accelerated using graphics processors.

We work closely with customers to develop innovative digital products, specialising in data-driven applications and conversational UI / chatbots. Our work is driven by new technology, user centred design and Agile methodologies. What makes us different is the team we work with; all our people are experts in their field and have world-class credentials to back it up. We are a small, specialised team and we offer a highly personal and collaborative service to our clients. We think creatively about technology and implement it strategically. We invest in new and interesting ideas and regularly release open-source code to the community. Our recent clients include the Bank of England, UEFA, NHS National Innovation Centre, Turner Broadcasting, Internews, and Mencap, along with a number of smaller organisations whom we love just as much. To find out about what we can do for you, give us a call or send us an email. John runs an agile, knowledgeable and experienced team of developers with a strong focus on enterprise, data-driven technical solutions. I have employed them for a recent, very challenging project mining the group associativity of social media networks. I was highly impressed by the way John runs his team, the agile way in which they approach the work and even more pleased with their ideas and technical input. I would recommend John and his team at Atchai to anyone who needs a competent solution for any data-oriented enterprise project. What I like about working with Atchai is that they take the time at the beginning of the project to understand the big picture before choosing the right tech stack for the job. What they delivered was cutting edge, very high quality software. All work was delivered on time, on budget, to a very high standard with clear, honest communication throughout. Atchai Digital created a highly innovative visualisation tool that successfully demonstrates the value of open health data on an imaginative open-source linked data platform. This step-change innovation, which was profiled extensively at an international semantic web conference and a Guardian review, represents an important contribution to health informatics. Atchai's ability to work in development sprints that result incompelling customer experiences is a clear signature. Having put together a very well thought out and concise proposal we chose Atchai to deliver a new framework to power websites and digital products for our growing general entertainment business and brands. John and his team came up with a technical approach which has proven to offer huge efficiencies in the production of TV channel support websites. We now have an underlying architecture which enables quick and efficient rollout of new websites, along with the tools to ensure that every site we produce is accessible across mobile devices.

The social network hosts online communities within a dedicated health web platform. There are currently over 700 different health communities on the HealthUnlocked website, for a wide range of health and wellbeing conditions. After registering to use the site, users can create a user profile and join one or more of these online communities. Many of the online communities are run in partnership with health organizations, non-profit organization's (NPO) and charities worldwide, including Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), British Liver Trust, Endometriosis UK and The Multiple Sclerosis Association Of America. Each month over 4M people from across the world come to the platform, the majority of which are from the UK and US. HealthUnlocked is in the top 20 private health websites globally according to Alexa Internet. HealthUnlocked is also available through an app for iPhone A study (2017) by University of Manchester concluded that use of the HealthUnlocked platform positively affects a persons Patient Activation Measure and research (University of Warwick, 2016) found use of platforms such as HealthUnlocked helps people to come together and cope with illnesses and diseases such as diabetes, cancer and mental health problems. The network was identified as a technology that will change health and care by the Kings Fund, a tech startup that is on track to become Britain's next billion dollar companies and won an award and named as a truly standout, disruptive innovation, in the AXA PPP Health Tech & You Awards (2017). HealthUnlocked was one of the first companies selected to join NHS England's, NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA) programme, which aims to have proven innovations adopted faster and more systematically through the NHS, delivering on the commitment detailed within the Five Year Forward View. HealthUnlocked works with organisations including think tanks and the pharmaceutical industry to better understand long term health conditions and to recruit people from its online health communities to surveys, advisory boards and panels, as well as clinical trials. An academic review into patient involvement in drug development found that social media and peer networks are evolving to play a much deeper role in innovation and clinical research in industry and changing opportunities for patients to participate in research and development of new therapies. A study into patients experiences on steroids taken from data on the health platform found that the timing of glucocorticoid administration varies significantly in patients, potentially influencing effectiveness and side effects. The company has also worked with the Institute for Public Policy Research, surveying its users to better understand the attitudes and activities of people with long-term conditions.","id":"7566168d57e9f173ac53b5b3dd8b6b31b2665192","location":{"lat":51.52381,"lon":-0.109248,"postcode":"EC1R3HN"},"name":"HealthUnlocked","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Alexa_Internet","Axa","Five_Year_Forward_View","Social_networking_service","Artificial_intelligence","Diabetes","Disruptive_innovation","Endometriosis","Glucocorticoid","IPhone","NHS_England","Nonprofit_organization","The_Social_Network","United_States_dollar","University_of_Manchester","University_of_Warwick","Patient_Activation_Measure","Academic_Health_Science_Networks","Cancer","HealthUnlocked","Patient_participation","Pharmaceutical_industry"],"topics":[{"id":"Alexa_Internet","score":100},{"id":"Axa","score":100},{"id":"Five_Year_Forward_View","score":100},{"id":"Social_networking_service","score":100},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":90},{"id":"Diabetes","score":90},{"id":"Disruptive_innovation","score":90},{"id":"Endometriosis","score":90},{"id":"Glucocorticoid","score":90},{"id":"IPhone","score":90},{"id":"NHS_England","score":90},{"id":"Nonprofit_organization","score":90},{"id":"The_Social_Network","score":90},{"id":"United_States_dollar","score":90},{"id":"University_of_Manchester","score":90},{"id":"University_of_Warwick","score":90},{"id":"Patient_Activation_Measure","score":80},{"id":"Academic_Health_Science_Networks","score":70},{"id":"Cancer","score":70},{"id":"HealthUnlocked","score":60},{"id":"Patient_participation","score":60},{"id":"Pharmaceutical_industry","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://healthunlocked.com/"},{"description":"Aeterno AI delivers the capability to simulate sustainable business strategy, and optimise outcomes for diverse stakeholder needs.

The manual processes and the lack of automation post build add significant cost and slow down production rates, thereby eroding many of the benefits of AM technology. This unconnected approach is slowing down the uptake of industrial 3D printing and preventing the expected competition with traditional manufacturing.

We are proud to say our Opportunity Execution Project made the front page of the most-voted list in Stanford University's recent course on Technology Entrepreneurship. Contact us through our front page if you want to discuss it with us. Our technology leaves us many free parameters to develop ultra-efficient integrated circuits for machine learning in many deep algorithms. Help us shape and chose those parameters so we can design the best chip for your application. Please visit our application calls page and answer no more than 6 questions to give us your view of machine learning and the opportunity ultra-efficient hardware would give you or contact us to discuss your needs. People like Hermann Hauser, founder of ARM, and industry big hitters like IBM and Microsoft say machine learning is the next big wave in computing after smartphones. But machine learning today consumes huge resources and is trapped in warehouses full of hot computers. In 2012, Google needed 16,000 processors burning megawatts of power just to learn to see cats in videos. This inefficiency severely limits machine learning applications in autonomous systems like robots, unmanned vehicles or the billions of sensors the Internet of Things will bring. Even with cheaper graphical processing unit (GPU) implementations, these systems would simply be too big and hot or tethered to a warehouse and power station to be able to learn independently. So we see a great opportunity in bridging the efficiency gap. We believe we know how. We are Artificial Learning Ltd, working with top UK universities to develop novel, ultra-efficient silicon chips specifically for machine learning. We want to make machine learning thousands - perhaps millions - of times more efficient. Instead of needing a warehouse and a power station, our integrated circuit designs will enable powerful machine learning to be embedded in devices that can sit in the palm of your hand and run on batteries.","id":"313135858799b2940584d59661e2e51a66a2969a","location":{"lat":51.530785,"lon":-0.093391,"postcode":"N17GU"},"name":"Artificial Learning","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Graphics_processing_unit","ARM_architecture","Google","Hermann_Hauser","IBM","Integrated_circuit","Machine_learning","Microsoft","Stanford_University","Wasted_vote","Electricity_generation","World_Wide_Web","Opportunity"],"topics":[{"id":"Graphics_processing_unit","score":100},{"id":"ARM_architecture","score":90},{"id":"Google","score":90},{"id":"Hermann_Hauser","score":90},{"id":"IBM","score":90},{"id":"Integrated_circuit","score":90},{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90},{"id":"Microsoft","score":90},{"id":"Stanford_University","score":90},{"id":"Wasted_vote","score":80},{"id":"Electricity_generation","score":70},{"id":"World_Wide_Web","score":70},{"id":"Opportunity","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://www.artificiallearning.com/"},{"description":"BIAMI.io is easy to use, secure and scalable enterprise-ready framework to automate your work and build intelligent business process driven software, platforms and robots.","id":"7ad18857a457ce114a7d4a68833a6f5d6f3953bd","location":{"lat":51.535787,"lon":-0.056915,"postcode":"E84RT"},"name":"BIAMI.io","name_extra":"Intelligent Automation","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Business_process"],"topics":[{"id":"Business_process","score":100}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://www.biami.io"},{"description":"At our core we have a team of biomedical engineers and data scientists who are passionate about extracting meaning from complex data sets.

Our team is made of AI experts with backgrounds from MIT, Cambridge University, ETH Zurich, Ecole Polytechnique, BNP Paribas London, Paris School of Economics and Bank of France and whose research is cited by hundreds of scientific papers and published at the best international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AISTATS or AAAI. We are building a dashboard allowing risk/asset managers and their analysts to obtain the right information edge at the right time. We do so by dynamically processing news, press releases, company filings, investment research or earnings transcripts, and leveraging advanced AI and mathematical methods, some as recent as Fall 2020, including among others non-trivial usage of transformers and topological data analysis. We are motivated by mitigating the risks of another financial crisis due to a lack of timely access to the right economic insights. Indeed, the sanity of the global financial system relies on investors and insurers correctly measuring the inherent risks to their positions, and failure to adequately process the relevant data in time may result in credit defaults or under-performance: an overall lost value for the economy. What adds to the issue is that the amount of unstructured textual data available to the actors of the Finance & Insurance industry has lately grown to an overwhelming degree. Fortunately, 2020 has seen unprecedented breakthroughs in the scientific community of text analytics.

Unlike many corporate presentation tools which instruct people on \"how to\" present or speak in public, but often yield short term results, the gweek app - a \"personal communication coach\" - takes a more intuitive approach. Based on the belief that everyone is inherently Speech Intelligent, gweek helps harness the skills people already possess but don't necessarily know how to use, such as clarity and structure in speech. The software is comprised of learning levels, to help users achieve key milestones, or to simply provide help with rehearsing speech. gweek is a cognitive technology in that it knows what to listen and look for in order to help in a constructive, non-judgmental way. gweek uses audio and visual layers of machine learning to provide real-time analytics and bite-sized, micro-learning chunks. It empowers users to express themselves more effectively, and to tap into their most valuable currency – the way they present themselves. It empowers users to communicate 'with' not 'at' people. Through the use of smart Speech Intelligence Analytics, gweek has been able to consistently measure the components that make up clear, confident, yet authentic communication - to create a system which accurately scores users in real-time and helps them to improve their speaking capabilities. In both 2017 and 2018, gweek was recognised by CognitionX as a pioneer in its field by winning the AI Award for Innovation in Natural Language Processing.","id":"930489c44a579ffcf24db658e8f66886b99713ad","location":{"lat":51.519542,"lon":-0.098888,"postcode":"EC1A7LP"},"name":"gweek","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Natural_language_processing","WhatsApp","Machine_learning","Artificial_intelligence","Gweek","Intelligence"],"topics":[{"id":"Natural_language_processing","score":100},{"id":"WhatsApp","score":100},{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Gweek","score":80},{"id":"Intelligence","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.gweekspeech.com"},{"description":"Transforming investment research using knowledge graphs and NLP","id":"2afe066ac5c9025b45d79ac05c2a437f9895bc40","location":{"lat":51.523891,"lon":-0.083802,"postcode":"EC2A4DP"},"name":"Auquan","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Natural_language_processing"],"topics":[{"id":"Natural_language_processing","score":50}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://auquan.com"},{"description":"InReach Ventures builds its own proprietary software and AI to discover and invest in the best early-stage startups from all over Europe.","id":"e7afb31ce7276050473888993c5ee5f7589fd07d","location":{"lat":51.502486,"lon":-0.110653,"postcode":"SE18SB"},"name":"InReach Ventures","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Artificial_intelligence","Proprietary_software"],"topics":[{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Proprietary_software","score":80}],"types":["0","1"],"url":"https://www.inreachventures.com/"},{"description":"BatteryDev is a battery data and technology company.

Although Arabic is the fifth most spoken language in the world, and it is one of the six formal languages in the United Nations, the data available in Arabic is still remarkably of low quality. This constitutes a major obstacle to the computer processing of the Arabic language, especially machine learning models that rely heavily on data volume, quality, and good organization.

Over a minimum of a 5-year period, Fusionex will be deploying Big Data Analytics to increase the efficiency of its client's interaction with existing customers, as well as provide solutions to utilize available data in order to craft better offerings that would empower the client to capture newer markets. In order to gain a better outlook of the performance and health of the client's sales activities, a cost utilization analytics module will be provided by Fusionex. This will help the client inform its corporate customers about the performance of their corporate accounts – e.g. details such as how much cost has been utilized by staff, how much was claimed for spouses or dependents, and even illnesses involved and medical facilities visited. This will help corporate customers determine if their account is being fully or partially utilized, and whether or not coverage should be increased for their staff. The cost utilization analytics module can also be used by the client's team to generate new products that they can upsell and cross-sell to existing customers. Fusionex and the client will also be working closely together to formulate strategies to penetrate the insurance market through social media analytics and digital marketing. Capturing the right data in a timely manner is important for decision makers in the client's organization, to determine long term strategies as well as day to day actions. To achieve this, Fusionex GIANT 2017 (targeted for official release imminently) will not only accumulate and cleanse disparate datasets, but also be used to find historical patterns and predict future trends in data (structured, semi-structured and unstructured). Via GIANT, the client will be able to determine claim patterns of its customers and will be able to craft products that better cater to these customers, focusing on their specific needs. The client will also be able to cross sell products if they identify, for example, the trend of city dwellers – e.g. allowing for targeted auto insurance products and sales. By putting business and customer data to effective use, the client is able to transform seemingly dormant information into game-changing insights that can help them satisfy their customers, improve their offerings, and boost their bottom-line. Ivan Teh, Fusionex Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"We are delighted to enter into this long-term partnership with such a valued client, which is in line with our mission of using technology to enable businesses to be more agile, and with greater impact. Fusionex is committed towards helping the client gain an optimum leverage in its field.","id":"1d54b6645756f562c7bddb25d8b19540067fe018","location":{"lat":51.504938,"lon":-0.019496,"postcode":"E145AA"},"name":"Fusionex","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Digital_marketing","United_States_dollar","Big_data","Artificial_intelligence","City","Deep_learning","Internet_of_things","Vehicle_insurance"],"topics":[{"id":"Digital_marketing","score":90},{"id":"United_States_dollar","score":90},{"id":"Big_data","score":70},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":60},{"id":"City","score":60},{"id":"Deep_learning","score":60},{"id":"Internet_of_things","score":60},{"id":"Vehicle_insurance","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.fusionex-international.com/"},{"description":"Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, an umbrella term that includes multiple technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), are being increasingly deployed across consumer, enterprise, and government markets around the world.

Extreme susceptibility of quantum computation to noise is one of the crucial factors that hinder the development of large-scale quantum computers. By the means of optimising gate count in a quantum circuit, it is possible to significantly reduce hardware errors and increase the accuracy of quantum computation. Optimal (or near-optimal) circuit compilation is an extremely challenging and still open problem due to additional constraints imposed by hardware configuration, such as restricted qubit connectivity and hardware-native gate set.

The system was initially developed in 1983 as a music composition tool, where the composer manipulates the paths of counterpoint melodies. The development of the system was inspired by Leonard Bernstein's Harvard Lectures on music theory based on Chomskyan linguistics - titled The Unanswered Question. Chomsky said: 'He (Bernstein) was onto something, but I couldn't really judge how significant it was...'. Bernstein's analysis of Mozart's 40th in G Minor showed characteristics corresponding to the physical Principle of Least Action and symmetry over scale analogous to gauge invariance in field theory. This analysis formed the starting point from which Generic AI was ultimately developed. By 1989 the core theoretical problem was solved; this took the form of a general-purpose artificial intelligence system. However, it was apparent that it would be at least 20 years before it could be implemented, due to the rate of improvement in computing power. By 2002 parallel processing was close enough to start developing commercial applications taking into account the development time, and so the company: Generic AI Ltd was incorporated. Our objective is to demonstrate the 'Artificial General Intelligence' (AGI) properties of the system by creating as many varied applications as possible. Generic AI has these properties: The core Generic AI system always works in the same way for every application It has no pre-programmed rules The data it processes is in a universal format Customised interfaces convert data into this core universal format Patterns and features exist in a kind of 'common currency' between all possible kinds of data input. This enables meaningful data-fusion between disparate data sources.","id":"417ee817fcc1904063d69dda738eb2f32c8f4b85","location":{"lat":54.972398,"lon":-1.611337,"postcode":"NE16BX"},"name":"Generic Ai","name_extra":"","place_id":"aaa8db814aba407fb015339465a996dfe2cdb4a6","topicIds":["Noam_Chomsky","Artificial_Intelligence_System","Artificial_intelligence","Computational_linguistics","Harvard_University","Leonard_Woolf","The_Unanswered_Question","Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart","Artificial_general_intelligence","Gauge_theory","Music_theory","Counterpoint","Leonard_Bernstein","Parallel_computing"],"topics":[{"id":"Noam_Chomsky","score":100},{"id":"Artificial_Intelligence_System","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":90},{"id":"Computational_linguistics","score":90},{"id":"Harvard_University","score":90},{"id":"Leonard_Woolf","score":90},{"id":"The_Unanswered_Question","score":90},{"id":"Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_general_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Gauge_theory","score":80},{"id":"Music_theory","score":70},{"id":"Counterpoint","score":60},{"id":"Leonard_Bernstein","score":60},{"id":"Parallel_computing","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://generic-ai.co.uk/"},{"description":"FOTENIX are an ability provider, enabling smart operation of agricultural machinery.

Looking across a £725m transformation budget and an internal network of nearly 6000 people, GainX surfaced 7% declining productivity in the last quarter, poor adoption of strategic programmes (agile, cloud) costing over £60M in annual losses, £31 in duplicate work, and much more. Designed exclusively for executives, GainX AI provides a global dashboard that predicts the outcome of any strategy, including programme failures and delays, duplicate work, changes in productivity, sentiment, organisation health and capacity to change – with drill down into the critical details in seconds. Every insight is quantified – with immediate savings identified, and predictions on future, unexpected cost increases. GainX delivers millions in immediate cost savings, and provides assurance in meeting strategic targets and ROI. Years of hidden delays sit, cumulatively, across complex strategic portfolios. GainX AI provides assurance in meeting strategic targets and ROI by predicting delays before they occur, surfacing trends in behaviour and delivery, and suggesting root causes and recommendations. GainX ingests multiple sources of big data including communications, projects and financial data. Insights, that up until now have been impossible to surface at the speed and accuracy of GainX, are automated via a unique scientific blend of Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Programming, Anthropology and Machine Learning and measured systemically.","id":"21c8a0ea0d684436b914e6c1b28ab71481e01f52","location":{"lat":51.520751,"lon":-0.083112,"postcode":"EC2A4BT"},"name":"GainX ltd","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Cloud_computing","Executive_Decision","Artificial_intelligence","Big_data","Machine_learning","Scenario_planning"],"topics":[{"id":"Cloud_computing","score":90},{"id":"Executive_Decision","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Big_data","score":80},{"id":"Machine_learning","score":70},{"id":"Scenario_planning","score":70}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.gainx.com"},{"description":"Flowd cleverly utilises AI to help high-ticket, B2B companies effortlessly scale from personalised email marketing.","id":"6ea411119aa152cb13c7a3d58ddd8f5d72cdc233","location":{"lat":53.477108,"lon":-2.243683,"postcode":"M15AN"},"name":"Flowd","name_extra":"","place_id":"362e8efad120999b76976d93a06b1a34999efa77","topicIds":["Email_marketing","Artificial_intelligence","Business-to-business"],"topics":[{"id":"Email_marketing","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Business-to-business","score":70}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.flowd.co.uk"},{"description":"Digital Innovators .ai is a board and C-suite advisory service helping companies digitally innovate and transform through the use of AI, machine learning and data science.","id":"b3d203e76ff76ad00ce57010ff1de7f6d1bf3742","location":{"lat":51.491882,"lon":-0.182874,"postcode":"SW74NH"},"name":"Digital Innovators .ai","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Machine_learning","Artificial_intelligence","Data_science","Corporate_title"],"topics":[{"id":"Machine_learning","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Data_science","score":70},{"id":"Corporate_title","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.digitalinnovators.ai"},{"description":"Humanising Autonomy is a predictive AI company that delivers the global standard for human interaction with automated systems.

Artificial Intelligence is moving from the cloud to embedded applications. This is enabling a wide range of use cases including automotive, defence, manufacturing, healthcare and agriculture. Machine Learning ecosystems have been built mostly on GPUs for the cloud, where neural networks are generally very large and inefficient. These cloud based neural networks and power hungry GPUs make the AI use cases requiring embedded inference more difficult or impossible to engineer. FPGAs provide the ideal AI inference platform where low size, weight and power are design criteria. The FPGA's efficiency and low power consumption are better able to deliver embedded applications. iAbra's tools ensure that efficient neural networks are created and optimised for embedded FPGA silicon, delivering low power AI inference for a variety of applications. iAbra Neural PathWorks is the machine learning software platform from iAbra.

Using our robots, we can provide accurate, high-resolution 3D models and other visualizations to determine the condition of an infrastructure nearly in real-time. This innovative approach is beneficial to carry out inspections of underground, closed or confined areas. This is particularly the case under harsh, dark and dangerous conditions where the inspection process based on current methods entails a major health risk for human operators. Besides the gain in safety our approach boosts the overall efficiency of the process as well as the accuracy of the obtained results. The solution was successfully tested on a global scale in real environments such as underground mines, penstocks in hydroelectric dams, nuclear waste detection and tunnel construction. Further industries have shown significant interest in the technology to carry out inspections. We consider ourselves as a data service company, where the inhouse-developed robot is used as the main tool to gather the data. One of our principles is to keep the highest possible manufacturing range in-house ensuring the control of the supply chain, the delivered quality to the customer as well as the corresponding lead-time.","id":"29c9dcf947cee82448977a5d765bfb9c6ed2a294","location":{"lat":51.412407,"lon":-0.207554,"postcode":"SW193NW"},"name":"Hovering Solutions","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Satellite_navigation","Industrial_robot","Hydroelectricity","Radioactive_waste","Supply_chain","Three-dimensional_space"],"topics":[{"id":"Satellite_navigation","score":100},{"id":"Industrial_robot","score":90},{"id":"Hydroelectricity","score":80},{"id":"Radioactive_waste","score":70},{"id":"Supply_chain","score":60},{"id":"Three-dimensional_space","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.hoveringsolutions.com"},{"description":"Fast Reaction to Market Change Our experienced programmatic servicing team react fast to the changing market dynamics and switch to optimal budget and campaign settings with machine learning whenever needed.

To do which, we provide integrated and interoperable information to whom, when and how it is needed – to clinicians, of course, and to the patient especially. By these means, we liberate them from disconnected silos that inevitably lead to less-than-integrated care. With advanced analytics and artificial intelligence, clinicians can show, for example, how multiple combinations of genomic attributes, prescribed drugs and test results lead to actual clinical outcomes. Using these analyses, clinical researchers can benchmark pathways and infer new best-practice, to embed improvement at great scale. Our \"Future Perfect\" for Healthcare: making health and care maximally intelligent will be achieved by: Creating the evidence base needed to inform how to care (or self-care), making it relevant, extensive, constantly expanded and updated Collecting the data from across prescribing, diagnostic, genomic, robotic and digital sources Liberating and democratising the data, breaking down silos, making it ready for us to develop and deploying new applications for advanced analyses Deploying AI tools to analyse such massive data - for example, to show the actual clinical outcomes people experience linked to their genomic attributes, diagnostic and interventive procedures and prescribed drugs Using these analyses to benchmark and infer new best-practice Closing the loop and re-do the cycle, embedding improvement at great scale.

By providing an end-to-end solution we are able to offer a streamlined route for water utilities to innovate whilst rapidly realising the benefits; without needing to piece together the solution themselves. Historically sensors have only measured a few parameters, our Intellisondes accurately measure up to 8 parameters at once. By measuring these parameters, we have managed to use our devices to identify the root cause of discolouration issues, water source mixing, leakage, chemical dosing issues and reservoir ingress, many of which are not possible without the combination of parameters provided by the Intellisonde. Often communications can be overlooked, but providing reliable access to data is key to being able to use that data for decision making. As a result, we created the Intellihub, our communications module, which is able to provide high data availability underground in remote locations, regularly achieving above 95% data availability in some of the most challenging environments. In order to interpret the data and make it useful for decision making, we created our intelligence systems which use bespoke AI algorithms to extract meaningful insights from the data. Our systems can work with 3rd party data or our own sensors, enabling the utilities to get greater value out of their existing assets. The data is visualised through our Insight web-app, this provides intuitive ways to see exactly which parts of the water network need addressing as well as offering tools to enable drilling-down into the root of the problem. Our system automatically processes the data ready for visualisation meaning information on water source mixing, root cause analysis for discolouration, leakage or reservoir ingress are all available instantly through our Insight web-app.","id":"22ccdbe51ac14b57ab5f39beb3a018e077ddf632","location":{"lat":50.983133,"lon":-1.463429,"postcode":"SO519DL"},"name":"Intellitect Water Limited","name_extra":"","place_id":"98756738b15c1eb573275e336cfa54ca2cf441b3","topicIds":["Artificial_intelligence","Thermodynamics","Intelligence"],"topics":[{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Thermodynamics","score":80},{"id":"Intelligence","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.intellitect-water.co.uk"},{"description":"AI based data extraction system is ready to automatically extract valuable data points such as date, address, document number, etc. Types of documents can be gas certificates, tenant agreements, and many more.

So we set out to bridge the gap between the insurance industry of today and the emerging technologies of tomorrow. We began in the commercial drone industry, using real-time data (like population density and wind speed) to quantify, insure, and mitigate drone flight risks. We insured thousands of innovative drone operations globally, from agricultural surveyors to NHS medical delivery flights. Our technology helped thousands of pilots around the world to fly safer, reducing their risk exposure by 15% on average. We recently expanded into the rapidly evolving world of connected motor fleets. Modern fleets change on a daily basis; expanding, contracting, and adopting the latest technology. They need an insurance policy that's as agile and data-driven as they are; so we launched Flock Motor, our connected vehicle division offering insurance designed for the 21st-century fleet. But we're not done yet. The world is becoming increasingly connected and autonomous, bringing both amazing opportunities and complex risks. As the insurer of the future, Flock will not only pay claims when incidents occur; we'll help our customers understand and mitigate their own risks, to avoid things going wrong in the first place. We are making the world a safer, smarter place.","id":"fe5dbca55d3206cb7d6c9bb002b1c82bd9d2f013","location":{"lat":51.516945,"lon":-0.077927,"postcode":"EC2M4YJ"},"name":"Flock Ltd.","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Cell_division","Population_density","National_Health_Service","Bridge","Unmanned_aerial_vehicle"],"topics":[{"id":"Cell_division","score":90},{"id":"Population_density","score":90},{"id":"National_Health_Service","score":80},{"id":"Bridge","score":60},{"id":"Unmanned_aerial_vehicle","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://www.flockcover.com/"},{"description":"Infogistics designs and builds AI-driven content-aware text-analysis, content extraction and document retrieval solutions across multiple industries including HR, Staffing, CRM, Healthcare, Banking and Social Media.

Founded in 2015 out of Maxwell Harding's frustration with lunchtime queues, Dynamify's digital ordering technology is now deployed in North America, the U.K., Continental Europe and Asia. Contract catering clients include Sodexo, Elior, Atalian, CH&CO, BaxterStorey, Gather & Gather, Bartlett Mitchell, Lexington, Vacherin, The Good Eating Company and cloud canteens Nourish, Fooditude, Foodee and Alchemista. Dynamify's modular technology contains all the features required by caterers within one app: ranging from preordering and self-checkout to delivery. Dynamify's proprietary algorithm tells operators how long it will take them to prepare an order based on the time of the day and the type of order, then intelligently matches demand and supply to predict accurate order collection times and reduce crowding. Dynamify's analytics dashboard provides powerful insights, including predictions of each customer's lifetime value and food consumption patterns using machine learning, which can be leveraged for personalised marketing and inventory management. Dynamify's contact-free technology has become essential for caterers to resume operations during coronavirus. Dynamify can launch a best-in-class app, which enables caterers to safely and conveniently provide food to their customers at the office and at home, within 24 hours.

Download the full white paper here. The authors believe that AI could become the most transformative workplace technology of the 21st century, with the associated need for business leaders to assure themselves that they are deploying AI effectively and responsibly. Superhuman Resources sets out a series of practical questions for businesses to address in respect of AI in the areas of governance and quality assurance, in addition to tackling crucial legal considerations. These include privacy and data processing legislation compliance, the potential for discriminatory outputs from AI systems, and the fair allocation of risk. This guidance is set against a regulatory backdrop that poses distinct challenges for policymakers and corporate governance. While the growth of AI is no different from that of other fields of innovation in respect of the need to develop ethics and laws simultaneously, it offers a real opportunity for businesses to shape and influence legal and regulatory frameworks as they begin to adapt to machine-based processes, products and services","id":"f8f5bc560405fee470accdb8256b4587d582360a","location":{"lat":51.517393,"lon":-0.14954,"postcode":"W1G9XS"},"name":"Faculty","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Artificial_intelligence","White_paper","International_law","Anne-Marie_Slaughter","Business_ethics","Corporate_governance"],"topics":[{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":90},{"id":"White_paper","score":80},{"id":"International_law","score":70},{"id":"Anne-Marie_Slaughter","score":60},{"id":"Business_ethics","score":60},{"id":"Corporate_governance","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://faculty.ai/"},{"description":"eXvisory.ai is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform enabling global product companies to quickly build and deploy convenient and effective self-service AI support applications with deep troubleshooting knowledge, saving costs by eliminating or reducing human support contacts and improving support outcomes and customer satisfaction.","id":"b97e346d44b636d091fc0784f9473931caa8ae91","location":{"lat":51.701558,"lon":-0.962522,"postcode":"OX394NH"},"name":"eXvisory.ai","name_extra":"","place_id":"4866ce031bb30e9dcc1f04a7a87a8a564e3b5bd9","topicIds":["Software_as_a_service","Artificial_intelligence"],"topics":[{"id":"Software_as_a_service","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80}],"types":["0"],"url":"https://exvisory.ai"},{"description":"The University of Nottingham shares many of the characteristics of the world's great universities.

This extraordinary sum represents hundreds of millions of human hours spent on tedious, grinding, soul-crushing work which is also slow and prone to errors. The incumbent technology, OCR (optical character recognition) has been around for decades. It's simplistic, rule-based and performs poorly on many real-life documents. We founded Evolution AI in 2015 to solve that problem. Evolution AI revolutionised data extraction by building a deep-learning machine that closely mimics how humans read documents. Humans not only read characters off the page, we heavily rely on visual cues from graphic design (tables, font types and sizes, colours, bold/italic etc) and of course - on meaning and context. In AI terms, these translate to Visual Reasoning - a branch of computer vision that focuses on how objects visually relate to each other - and NLP (Natural Language Processing), dealing with meaning and semantics. In short, our AI weaves together text, vision and semantics to extract data from documents - just like humans do. Today we process over 1.5M pages per day for our clients. Our unique scientific approach enables us to automatically extract data from any type of document including the most complicated such as quarterly reports, balance sheets, P&L statements, account statements, invoices etc.","id":"9c513ea7300ee25a649c5e35611910592fbd458a","location":{"lat":51.504989,"lon":-0.093604,"postcode":"SE11UN"},"name":"Evolution AI","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Natural_language_processing","Optical_character_recognition","Computer_vision","Human_Hours","Artificial_intelligence","Graphic_design"],"topics":[{"id":"Natural_language_processing","score":100},{"id":"Optical_character_recognition","score":100},{"id":"Computer_vision","score":90},{"id":"Human_Hours","score":90},{"id":"Artificial_intelligence","score":80},{"id":"Graphic_design","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://evolution.ai"},{"description":"We are a skilled data science consultant firm that helps companies unleash the value of their data, boost business efficiency and outsmart your competition.

They combine industry expertise with innovative technology to deliver critical information to leading decision makers in the financial, legal, tax & accounting, scientific, healthcare and media markets, powered by the world's most trusted news organization. RVC, the former venture capital arm of Reuters, was set up in 1994 and began investing RVC I (originally known as The Greenhouse Fund) in Palo Alto, California in 1995. In 1997, RVC expanded the focus of its operations to Europe, bringing its significant Silicon Valley experience to a market with relatively few venture capitalists focused on early stage information technology companies. In September 2001, RVC became independent from Reuters and is now wholly owned by its Investment Partners and Chairman. It was awarded the contract to continue managing RVC I on behalf of Reuters. In establishing its investment independence, RVC has retained its strong relationships with Reuters, its affiliates (Tibco, Factiva, Instinet, Radianz) and its customers, which are primarily financial services and media companies who were amongst the first to be impacted by and adopt new technology. Building on RVC's relationship with Reuters in financial services, RVC is developing similar relationships with leading corporations in other verticals, and acquiring deeper understanding of the needs and challenges CIOs and business decision makers have in increasing efficiency and/or revenues through their leverage of IT investments. In early 2004, after 10 years of successful technology investments, Reuters announced a strategy of refocusing on its core activities and away from venture technology investments. Over the ensuing few months, the partners at RVC explored the opportunity of buying RGF and successfully obtained debt financing for the purchase. On 22 June 2004, Norman Fiore, Martin Stapleton and John Taysom along with Chairman Sir David Walker became the new owners of RGF via their new vehicle Sofius Capital. RVC will remain the manager of the RGF and will continue to invest in RGF portfolio companies to maximise the overall return on the committed capital of the fund. Since inception, RVC I has invested €449 million in 82 companies, including Yahoo!, Verisign, Phone.com (now Openwave Systems), Digimarc, Infoseek, Orchestream, and Metamerge, amongst others. With 16 IPOs and 27 trade sales or other cash realisations, and a first fund that is 94% returned, they believe they have one of the strongest track records in Europe. Today, RVC has 11 staff located in London and the Silicon Valley.","id":"b2803675b44b9c35d198ca25b56e649502907999","location":{"lat":51.510551,"lon":-0.154169,"postcode":"W1K2NB"},"name":"Reuters Venture Capital","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Factiva","Infoseek","Instinet","Palo_Alto,_California","City_of_London","David_Walker_(banker)","Glenn_L._Martin_Company","Silicon_Valley","Verisign","Yahoo!","Deeper_Understanding","Venture_capital","Digimarc","Openwave","TIBCO_Software","Financial_services","Stapleton_International_Airport","Thomson_Reuters"],"topics":[{"id":"Factiva","score":100},{"id":"Infoseek","score":100},{"id":"Instinet","score":100},{"id":"Palo_Alto,_California","score":100},{"id":"City_of_London","score":90},{"id":"David_Walker_(banker)","score":90},{"id":"Glenn_L._Martin_Company","score":90},{"id":"Silicon_Valley","score":90},{"id":"Verisign","score":90},{"id":"Yahoo!","score":90},{"id":"Deeper_Understanding","score":80},{"id":"Venture_capital","score":80},{"id":"Digimarc","score":70},{"id":"Openwave","score":70},{"id":"TIBCO_Software","score":70},{"id":"Financial_services","score":60},{"id":"Stapleton_International_Airport","score":60},{"id":"Thomson_Reuters","score":60}],"types":["1"],"url":"//rvc.com"},{"description":"Leader in Natural Language Technology, eCommerce search, mobile voice search","id":"8e9440e62d66b0b35649e482a3b172b57d371f97","location":{"lat":51.405619,"lon":-0.842066,"postcode":"RG412RX"},"name":"EasyAsk","name_extra":"","place_id":"28f9ba09f8d1077164299b0d915da80274c6dfa5","topicIds":["E-commerce","Voice_search"],"topics":[{"id":"E-commerce","score":60},{"id":"Voice_search","score":60}],"types":["0"],"url":"http://www.easyask.com"},{"description":"Featurespace is the world-leader in Adaptive Behavioural Analytics and creator of the ARIC Risk Hub for fraud prevention and AML transaction monitoring.

Traditional searching is done with keywords, in combination or proximity; semantic searching is done by expanding to related concepts, which are largely found in similar contexts. In contrast, the key concept behind our technology is very simple. We read the full content of the search document and compare the terms we find with the content of all of the other documents in the dataset. This approach is at the heart of our long-established plagiarism detection programs. The technology can be used for the identification of relevant information in any large document dataset.

All students from all the Colleges and Institutes are also University of London students, making them part of a community of over 120,000 students and giving them access to many services in London.

Postgraduate students apply directly to the College or Colleges they wish to study with.

The Colleges also have a wide range of short courses and summer programmes. Pre-university school students are also able to sample University of London courses and life through the Taster Course programme.

It is the oldest of the four ancient universities of Scotland and the third oldest university in the English-speaking world (following Oxford and Cambridge Universities). St Andrews was founded between 1410 and 1413, when the Avignon Antipope Benedict XIII issued a papal bull to a small founding group of Augustinian clergy. St Andrews is made up of a variety of institutions, comprising three colleges – United College (a union of St Salvator's and St Leonard's Colleges), St Mary's College, and St Leonard's College, the last named being a non-statutory revival of St Leonard's as a post-graduate society. There are 18 academic schools organised into four faculties.[5] The university occupies historic and modern buildings located throughout the town. The academic year is divided into two terms, Martinmas and Candlemas. In term time, over one-third of the town's population is either a staff member or student of the university.[6] The student body is notably diverse: over 145 nationalities are represented with 45% of its intake from countries outside the UK; about one-eighth of the students are from the rest of the EU and the remaining third are from overseas — 15% from North America alone.[7][8] The university's sport teams compete in BUCS competitions,[9] and the student body is known for preserving ancient traditions such as Raisin Weekend, May Dip, and the wearing of distinctive academic dress.[10] It is ranked as the third best university in the United Kingdom in two of three national league tables, behind Oxbridge.[11][12][13] The Guardian ranks first in the United Kingdom the Schools of Physics and Astronomy, International Relations, Computer Science, Geography, English and Mathematics,[12] whilst The Times and Sunday Times ranks the Schools of English, Management, Philosophy, Anatomy and Physiology and Middle Eastern and African Studies first[14] and the Complete University Guide ranks Management, Divinity and Middle Eastern and African Studies first.[15] The Times Higher Education World Universities Ranking names St Andrews among the world's Top 50 universities for Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities.[16][17] St Andrews consistently holds the highest student satisfaction scores amongst all multi-faculty universities in the United Kingdom.[18] St Andrews has many notable alumni and affiliated faculty, including eminent mathematicians, scientists, theologians, philosophers, and politicians. Recent alumni include the former First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond; former Secretary of State for Defence Michael Fallon; HM British Ambassador to China Barbara Woodward; United States Ambassador to Hungary Colleen Bell; Olympic cycling gold medalist Chris Hoy; and royals Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.

Many new developments are currently in progress at the College, including the completion of new buildings, workshops and studios; the creation of a new research hub; the expansion of joint projects with industry; the launch of four dynamic new courses; and the appointment of many new members of our academic teams. Our vision is to help develop great creative minds, and ideas that will be central to the cultural evolution of our societies.  Housed over two campuses in Kensington and Battersea, the RCA is surrounded by some of the most important spaces and events in London's art and design worlds, and an exciting social scene of bars, clubs and cafés.  The twenty-first-century RCA knows that its graduates contribute significant, real-world innovations across art, communication, critical writing, exhibition-making and design – both as practitioners and through research. Future innovation doesn't grow in isolation, and the RCA's new Schools, each led by a Dean who is a leading practitioner in his or her field, promote hybridity and opportunities for interdisciplinarity.","id":"4f43b24fc1839ef8d689bc07f83706aa82b05c39","location":{"lat":51.501314,"lon":-0.17891,"postcode":"SW72EU"},"name":"Royal College of Art","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Institute_for_Operations_Research_and_the_Management_Sciences","Academic_discipline","Battersea","Kensington","Royal_College_of_Art","University_of_London","Cultural_evolution","Interdisciplinarity","Master_of_Philosophy"],"topics":[{"id":"Institute_for_Operations_Research_and_the_Management_Sciences","score":100},{"id":"Academic_discipline","score":90},{"id":"Battersea","score":90},{"id":"Kensington","score":90},{"id":"Royal_College_of_Art","score":90},{"id":"University_of_London","score":90},{"id":"Cultural_evolution","score":70},{"id":"Interdisciplinarity","score":60},{"id":"Master_of_Philosophy","score":60}],"types":["3"],"url":"http://www.rca.ac.uk/"},{"description":"University of Exeter is an educational institution that offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the fields of accounting, biological science, computer science, drama, economics, and many other subjects.

The £12.5 million of private investment was matched with £25 million of public money.

Reading an article about the original Silicon Valley Internet Incubator, Y-Combinator, in 2011 convinced him that this was the safest route for investing. He then found that existing UK based incubators were mainly in London and required investment through a funding vehicle, not directly into the startups themselves, making it difficult for investors to benefit from the all important SEIS tax relief.

Changing global patterns of food consumption and related consumer expectations are putting enormous strain on the sustainability of food production and natural resources.

By 2050 the U.N. estimates that global agricultural production will need to increase by about 70%. Supply won't meet demand.

Through the activities of over 2,500 people across 34 countries and the development of innovative technologies, they aim to contribute enduring solutions to improve efficiency in the production of healthy and nutritious food to meet the food requirements borne out of the increasing demands of changing global population. Their purpose is to deliver lasting commercial and social benefit, using their expertise with a far-sighted perspective. They apply rigorous financial discipline to their activities in order to achieve long term commercial success. But they do so with the aim of making a positive and lasting impact on society by developing and investing in solutions they believe will make a material difference in meeting one of the defining challenges of their time — the provision of enough food to meet the demands of a changing global population, in a way which benefits people's health and wellbeing and nature.","id":"a9e648a3e30517024e7819bafd8f52b915240cc4","location":{"lat":51.511656,"lon":-0.146,"postcode":"W1K3JP"},"name":"Wheatsheaf Group","name_extra":"","place_id":"fe9dd256a87d91f7ce30a7f67a6aa1d222b86f8d","topicIds":["Sustainable_agriculture"],"topics":[{"id":"Sustainable_agriculture","score":60}],"types":["1"],"url":"//wheatsheafgroup.com"},{"description":"Playfair Capital is an early-stage fund that commits to companies early and with conviction.
