### Toggling the accessibility menu

Clicking the accessibility icon should:
	* open the menu if it was closed,
	* close it if it was open.

When the menu is open, it should appear at the center of the screen sligthly
toward the bottom.

To know how to use it, please check [this guide](/guides/a11ymenu).
