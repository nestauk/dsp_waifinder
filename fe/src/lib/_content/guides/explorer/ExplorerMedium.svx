## Navigating the explorer

### Left sidebar

On the left there is a sidebar hosting various panels to control filtering
criteria.

<Settings />

### Map

<MapIntro />

#### Navigating the map

To select an area of the map, you can:
	* pan by clicking and dragging the map around
	* zoom by:
		* using the mouse wheel, or
		* scrolling or pinching with the touch pad, or
		* clicking on the +/- buttons on the map
	* select a specific area directly, by pressing the shift-key, dragging a
rectangle with the pointer and then end dragging.

Enabling the auto-zoom checkbox in the top-left corner, zooms the map to fit the
selected orgs according to the current filtering criteria.

The scale in the top-right corner indicates the current level of zoom.

#### Interacting with markers

Hovering a single org or a star ray shows a pop-up with the same info displayed
in the org card (see below).

Clicking a single org or a star ray will pin it, so that the pop-up will
persist even when you remove the pointer from the red dot, so that you can click
on the org's website link or interact with its pills.

To un-pin an org, you can click anywhere in the map or on the pop-up background.

### Right sidebar

On the right there is a sidebar hosting various tabs.

#### Details tab

<DetailsIntro />

Clicking a topic pill should navigate to the correspondent Wikipedia page.

Hovering a topic pill should show a pop-up with:
	* the topic abstract, taken from Wikipedia
	* the topic thumbnail, also taken from Wikipedia, if available.

Hovering an org card should show a red dot on the card itself and a correspondent
red dot on the map, to help you visually identifying that org on the map.

#### Topics tab

<TopicsBarchartIntro />

Hovering a topic will show the same pop-up described in the section above.

#### Places tab

<PlacesBarchart />

#### Region tab

<RegionsBarchart />
