# Drone Industry Map

## About this map

This interactive map shows companies and research organisations operating in the civic and commercial drone industry in the UK. These have been classified by type of entity and, if they are a technology developer, by type of technology. Entities are represented on the map by coloured dots. Dots of multiple colours indicate entities that fall into multiple categories.

This map has been created as part of Nesta's Flying High Challenge, exploring the future of drones in UK cities. The full project report is available on the [Nesta website](https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/flying-high-challenge-future-of-drone-technology-in-uk-cities/).
